Crowdin provides data residency options to help organizations comply with internal policies and regional data protection laws. This article explains how it works in Crowdin and Crowdin Enterprise.

## Data Residency in Crowdin

In Crowdin, customer data is stored by default in the **US Data Center**. This setup is designed to provide reliable infrastructure and consistent performance for all users.

<Aside>
  Data center selection is not available in Crowdin.

## Data Residency in Crowdin Enterprise

When creating a new organization in Crowdin Enterprise, you can choose where your data will be stored, either in the US or the EU data center. This option is available to all Crowdin Enterprise users during the [organization creation](/enterprise/organization/#creating-an-organization) process.

### Selecting a Data Center

During sign-up, select your preferred region:

* **US Data Center** - hosted on AWS in the US-east-1 region (N. Virginia)
* **EU Data Center** - hosted on AWS in the EU-west-1 region (Ireland)

This selection determines where your organization's data will be stored at rest. All newly created resources will be stored in the selected region. Backups are also stored in the same region.

<Aside type="caution">
  Once an organization is created, the selected data region cannot be changed.
</Aside>

### Data Stored in the Selected Region

If you choose the EU or US data center, the following types of organization data will be stored in that region:

* Source files and translations
* Strings and their metadata
* Translation memories and glossaries
* Screenshots and visual context
* Project-level resources and reports
* User profiles and team membership info

### Data Stored Outside the Selected Region

Some categories of operational data may be stored or processed outside your selected region, depending on the service architecture. These include:

* User email addresses and authentication-related data (shared infrastructure)
* Global Translation Memory
* Billing and usage analytics
* System logs and identifiers
* Data from Crowdin Store apps and third-party integrations

<Aside type="caution">
  Crowdin Store apps are hosted in the US. Integration data may be stored in other regions depending on the provider.
</Aside>

### Limitations and Migration

There are no differences or limitations in features when using the EU or US data center. Both options provide full functionality.

Data center selection is only available when creating a new organization. Migration of an existing organization’s data to a different region is not supported.

### Compliance Considerations

Crowdin’s EU data center can help organizations align with regional requirements such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Storing data in the EU helps enhance compliance by ensuring that customer data remains within EU jurisdiction.

Crowdin is certified under ISO / IEC 27001: 2022 and maintains internal policies and processes that support secure and compliant data handling.
