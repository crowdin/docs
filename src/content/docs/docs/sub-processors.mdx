Crowdin provides a great deal of transparency regarding how we use your data, how we collect your data, and with whom we share your data. To that end, we provide this page, which details our sub-processors, how we use cookies, and where and how we perform any tracking on Crowdin.

## Crowdin Sub-processors

When we share your information with third party sub-processors, such as our vendors and service providers, we remain responsible for it. We work very hard to maintain your trust when we bring on new vendors, and we require all vendors to enter into data protection agreements with us that restrict their processing of Users' Personal Information.

## Sub-processor Updates

Prior to engaging any sub-processors, we perform due diligence to evaluate their privacy, security and confidentiality practices, and execute an agreement with them that implements their obligations.

When we bring on a new vendor or other sub-processor who handles our Users' Personal Information, or remove a sub-processor, or we change how we use a sub-processor, we will update this page. If you have questions or concerns about a new sub-processor, we'd be happy to help. Also, if you'd like to be notified when we add a new sub-processor, please contact us and we'll add you to the email list. Please contact us at [privacy@crowdin.com](mailto:privacy@crowdin.com)
