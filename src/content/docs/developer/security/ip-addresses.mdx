When you work with private integrations (e.g., integrations with self-hosted VCS) or use a firewall for your company network, you need to add dedicated Crowdin IP addresses and domains to the allowlist to ensure that it operates properly while staying secure. A similar approach is applicable when using Crowdin webhooks.

  The IP addresses listed below change periodically.
