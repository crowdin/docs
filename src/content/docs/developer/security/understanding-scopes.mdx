Scopes let you set the exact access type you need. Scopes limit access for the personal access tokens, OAuth tokens, and Crowdin apps. They don't provide any additional permissions except those the user already has.

The scopes you specify for the OAuth app on Crowdin will be shown to the users on the authorization form.
