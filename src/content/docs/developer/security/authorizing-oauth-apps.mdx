You can enable organization members to authorize your OAuth app.

When you build an OAuth app, implement the web application flow described below to obtain an authorization code and then exchange it for a token.

## Request Authorization Code

You should redirect the user to the `/oauth/authorize` endpoint with the following GET parameters:

```bash
https://accounts.crowdin.com/oauth/authorize
```

This will ask the user to approve the app access to their account based on the scopes specified in REQUESTED_SCOPES and then redirect back to the REDIRECT_URI you provided when creating an app.

### Parameters {#request-authorization-code-parameters}

<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><code>client_id</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Required.  You receive Client ID for the app when you register it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code class="whitespace-nowrap">redirect_uri</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Required. The URL in your application where users will be sent after authorization.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>response_type:</code><code>code</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Required. The parameter is used for the flow specification of an OAuth app.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>scope</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Required. Select the access your app requires from the list of scopes available. You can add multiple [scopes](/developer/understanding-scopes) separated by spaces (no need to use quotation marks).</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>state</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>An unguessable random string. Use it for extra protection against cross-site request forgery attacks.</td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The following Authorization Url will be created:

```bash wrap
https://accounts.crowdin.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=m50YenPpqac8u5D4dnK&redirect_uri=https://impact-mobile.com/auth/crowdin&response_type=code&scope=project+tm&state=d131dd02c5e6eec4
```

After successful authorization users are redirected back to your site:

```bash wrap
https://impact-mobile.com/auth/crowdin/?code=def50200df1fbb5ebac05f9288850d9e...0835bd3cf42&state=d131dd02c5e6eec4
```

If authorization has been declined, users are redirected to your website with an error:

```bash wrap
https://impact-mobile.com/auth/crowdin/?error=access_denied&state=d131dd02c5e6eec4
```

## Users Are Redirected Back to Your Site by Crowdin

If a user authorizes the app, Crowdin redirects back to your site and you can exchange the code received for an access token:

```bash
POST https://accounts.crowdin.com/oauth/token
```

### Parameters {#redirect-parameters}

<table>
  <thead>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Value</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
  <tr>
    <td><code>grant_type:</code> <code>authorization_code</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Required. The parameter is used for the flow specification of an OAuth app.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>client_id</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Required. You receive Client ID for the app when you register it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>client_secret</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Required.  You receive Client Secret for the app when you register it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>redirect_uri</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Required. The URL in your application where users will be sent after authorization. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><code>code</code></td>
    <td>string</td>
    <td>Required. Code received from the callback query string. </td>
  </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

For example, request in curl takes the following form:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  https://accounts.crowdin.com/oauth/token \
  -H "content-type: application/json" \
  -d "{
      \"grant_type\":\"authorization_code\",
      \"client_id\":\"m50YenPpqac8u5D4dnK\",
      \"client_secret\":\"yz35kYtjox...YE9Am\",
      \"redirect_uri\":\"https://impact-mobile.com/auth/crowdin\",
      \"code\":\"def50200df1fbb5ebac05f9288850d9e...0835bd3cf42\"
  }"
```

### Response {#redirect-response}

By default, the response takes the following form:

```json
{
  "access_token":"eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJS...lag1e_Zk4EdJ5diYfz0",
  "token_type":"bearer",
  "expires_in": 7200,
  "refresh_token": "b213c684ccaa7db1217e946e6ad...fff7ae"
}
```

## Make Requests to the API with the Access Token Returned

The access token now allows you to make requests to Crowdin API on behalf of the authorized user.

For example, in curl you can set the following Authorization header:

```bash wrap
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" https://api.crowdin.com/api/v2/projects
```

Crowdin Enterprise:

```bash wrap
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" https://<organization_domain>.api.crowdin.com/api/v2/projects
```

<Aside>
  To obtain the Crowdin Enterprise `organization_domain`, parse the access token structured according to JWT specifications, and extract the required `organization_domain` from it.

## Refresh Token

The access token received after a user authorizes the app has an expiration time. Access token expires in the number of seconds defined in the response.

To refresh a token without requiring the user to be redirected, send a POST request with the following body parameters to the authorization server:

```bash
POST https://accounts.crowdin.com/oauth/token
```

### Parameters {#refresh-token-parameters}

## Redirect URLs

You can register one or more redirect URLs when you create an OAuth Application on Crowdin.

For security reasons, if the URL is not included in the Application info you wonâ€™t be able to redirect users to this URL after authorization.
