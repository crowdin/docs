Crowdin Query Language (CroQL) is a tool for Crowdin Editor and Crowdin Enterprise Editor and Crowdin and Crowdin Enterprise API that allows you to retrieve needed localization resources based on specific conditions. Using CroQL, you can filter source strings and their translations for a specific target language, TM segments, and Glossary Terms.

You can use CroQL with the following API methods:

## Operators

Main CroQL operators are listed below. Use and combine them to set specific conditions for retrieving the needed content from Crowdin. To form your CroQL query, you can use the elements from the tables below.

### Arithmetic Operators

The arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematic operations with any numeric data types.

| Name           | Symbol | Example |
|----------------|--------|---------|
| Addition       | +      | 1 + 9   |
| Subtraction    | -      | 11 - 1  |
| Division       | /      | 20 / 2  |
| Multiplication | *      | 2 * 5   |
| Negation       | -      | -10     |

### Comparison Operators

The comparison operators are used to compare values and return `true` or `false`.

| Name             | Symbol                                                     | Aliases | Example                                                                                                                 |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Between          | `{{expression}} between {{expression}} and {{expression}}` |         | 5 between 1 and 10                                                                                                      |
| Equal            | =                                                          |         | 10 = 10                                                                                                                 |
| Not equal        | !=                                                         | ≠       | 1 != 10; 1 ≠ 10                                                                                                         |
| Greater          | &gt;                                                       |         | 10 &gt; 1                                                                                                               |
| Greater or equal | &gt;=                                                      | ≥       | 10 &gt;= 1; 10 ≥ 1                                                                                                      |
| Less             | &lt;                                                       |         | 1 &lt; 10                                                                                                               |
| Less or equal    | &lt;=                                                      | ≤       | 1 &lt;= 10; 1 ≤ 10                                                                                                      |
| Contains         | `{{string}} contains {{string}}`                           |         | `"Hello World" contains "Hello"`; `"Hello World" contains text`; `text contains "Hello World"`; `context contains text` |

### Logical Operators

The logical operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions or values and provide a single boolean output.

| Name | Symbol | Example                  |
|------|--------|--------------------------|
| And  | and    | 1 < 10 and 10 > 1        |
| Or   | or     | 1 < 10 or 10 > 1         |
| Xor  | xor    | 1 < 10 xor 10 > 1        |
| Not  | not    | not 1 < 10               |

### Filtration Operators

The filtration operators are used to filter the objects based on the specified condition.

| Name   | Symbol                               | Example                                   |
|--------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Filter | `{{collection}} where {{predicate}}` | `translations where (count of votes > 0)` |
| Match  | `{{object}} with {{predicate}}`      | `user with (login = "crowdin")`           |

### Conditional (Ternary) Operator

The ternary operator is used to check a condition specified in the first value, and if it’s `true` it returns the second value, but if it’s `false` it returns the third value.

| Name    | Symbol                                                     | Example                                |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Ternary | `If {{condition}} then {{expression}} else {{expression}}` | `If 1 < 10 then "less" else "greater"` |

### Fetch Operators

The fetch operators are used for retrieving data from the objects.

| Name       | Symbol                                     | Example                             |
|------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Mention    | `@user:{{string}}`; `@language:{{string}}` | `@user:"crowdin"`; `@language:"en"` |
| Member     | `{{member}} of {{object}}`                 | `count of translations`             |
| Identifier | `{{identifier}}`                           | `text`; `identifier`                |

### Scalar Operators

The scalar operators are used to declare values for further processing.

| Name     | Symbol         | Example                        |
|----------|----------------|--------------------------------|
| Integer  | `{{integer}}`  | 10                             |
| Float    | `{{float}}`    | 10.01                          |
| String   | `{{string}}`   | "crowdin"                      |
| Datetime | `{{datetime}}` | 'today'; '2021-03-16 00:00:00' |

### Group Operator

The group operator is used to determine the execution order of operators.

| Name  | Symbol | Example                                    |
|-------|--------|--------------------------------------------|
| Group | ( )    | 1 < 10 and (20 > 10 or 10 > 5)             |

## CroQL Query Examples

In this section, you can find practical examples of CroQL queries that will help you understand and use the querying capabilities within Crowdin. These examples can help you learn how to create your own queries to retrieve specific sets of data based on various criteria, such as translation status, user activity, and string properties.

### Strings Queries

These queries are used to retrieve information about source strings.

* Strings that have no Ukrainian translations with approvals or votes:
  ```graphql wrap
  count of translations where ( language = @language:"uk" and ( count of approvals > 0 or count of votes > 0 ) ) = 0
  ```

* Strings that have only one translation:
  ```graphql
  count of translations = 1
  ```

* Strings that have translations from only one specific user:
  ```graphql wrap
  count of translations > 0 and count of translations = count of translations where (user = @user:"crowdin")
  ```

* Strings that have at least one translation not from specific users:
  ```graphql
  count of translations where (user != @user:"crowdin") > 0
  ```

* Strings that have all translations not from specific users:
  ```graphql wrap
  count of translations > 0 and count of translations = count of translations where (user != @user:"crowdin")
  ```

* Strings filtered by identifier and numeric id of a file in your Crowdin project:
  ```graphql
  identifier = "key" and id of file = 777
  ```

* Strings that have unresolved issues filtered by numeric id of a file in your Crowdin project:
  ```graphql
  id of file = 777 and count of comments where (has unresolved issue) > 0
  ```

* Hidden strings that are not duplicates and have one or more translations:
  ```graphql
  is hidden and not is duplicate and count of translations > 0
  ```

* Strings that have one or more approvals:
  ```graphql
  count of languages summary where (approvalsCount >= 1) > 0
  ```

* Strings that have comments made by the user with a `crowdin` username:
  ```graphql
  count of comments where (user = @user:"crowdin") > 0
  ```

* Strings that contain "ABC" in the source text but don't contain "ABC" in their translations:
  ```graphql
  text contains "ABC" and (count of translations where (text contains "ABC") = 0)
  ```
