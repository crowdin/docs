Crowdin's API is a full-featured RESTful API that helps you integrate localization into your development process. The endpoints we use allow you to easily make calls to retrieve information and perform necessary actions.

Most of the functionality of Crowdin is available through the API. It allows you to create projects for translations, add and update files, download translations, and much more. In this way, you can script the complex actions that your situation requires.
