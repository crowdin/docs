<Aside type="tip">
  Before you can localize your Shopify app, make sure you've done the [i18n (internationalization) step](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/best-practices/internationalization).

  **I18n basically means:**

  Extract all translatable text from your code into a separate file. If your app has other things that are locale dependent (if the app displays currencies, renders dates, or even numbers), you may need to use proper i18n tools to display the data according to the rules of the target language.

## Overview

The translation process itself is simple with Crowdin. It involves integrating your Github (or any other GIT server) repository with Crowdin. Then your app's language resource files are imported into Crowdin, where they can be translated into different languages. Once the translations are complete, you can easily export them back to your Github repo. Most importantly, if you have updates in your app, Crowdin will pick the changes up and allow you to easily translate the new content.

    When you set up your Crowdin project, both source texts flow to Crowdin and translated content flows back. You can choose a translation vendor to buy translations from.

    As a Shopify partner, you may be eligible for Shopify to cover the cost of localizing your app. Be sure to contact [support@shopify.com](mailto:support@shopify.com) before purchasing translations.

    To be eligible for reimbursement, you should buy translations from the following translation vendors:

    - [BLEND](https://store.crowdin.com/partners/blend)
    - [Translated](https://store.crowdin.com/partners/translated)

      <p>As you localize your application, more parts of your operations will likely become multilingual. For example, emails you send or help pages you offer to customers.</p>
      <p>Crowdin will serve as your LangOps tool for your global operations.

      <p>All branches can be synchronized to Crowdin and translated in parallel with the development process, ensuring that localization doesn't delay your release.</p>

      <h3 class="!text-lg">✅ Context and Quality Translations</h3>
      <p>Since resource files usually don't contain enough contextual information for linguists, it is always recommended to provide textual information for your keys (UI copy), upload screenshots of your app, and be sure to respond to linguists when they request context when translating your project.</p>
