The Editor Asset Panel module allows your app to replace the default asset preview panel in the Editor. When a user opens an asset, your app can take over the entire preview area if the asset's file name matches a pattern you define.

This functionality is particularly useful for handling file types that are not natively previewable in the Editor, such as video, audio, or other proprietary formats. If an asset's file name matches the `fileNamePattern` specified in your app's manifest, your app will be loaded in place of the default preview. If there is no match, the standard Crowdin preview panel will be displayed.

## Access

You can grant access to this module to one of the following user categories:

For Crowdin:

* Only me (i.e., project owner)
* Me, project managers and developers
* All project members
* Selected users

For Crowdin Enterprise:

* Only organization admins
* Organization admins, project managers and developers
* All users in the organization projects
* Selected users

## Structure

## How It Works

The Editor Asset Panel module operates on an event-driven mechanism. When a user navigates to an asset within the Editor, the system checks for any installed apps that use this module.

1. **Pattern Matching**: Crowdin takes the `fileNamePattern` from your app's `manifest.json` and tests it against the name of the currently opened asset (e.g., `clip.mov`).
2. **App Initialization**: If the asset's file name matches the pattern, Crowdin replaces the default preview panel with an iframe pointing to your app's `url`.
3. **Event Handling**: Once your app is loaded, Crowdin dispatches events to it, which your app must subscribe to and handle. These events contain the necessary data (payload) for your app to display the correct asset content.

The primary events are:

* `asset.source.preview`: Dispatched when the user clicks on the source asset preview.
* `asset.suggestion.preview`: Dispatched when the user clicks on a translated asset preview.

Your app should listen for these events to implement its custom preview logic, such as rendering a video player or an audio console. If an asset's file name does not match the `fileNamePattern`, the default Crowdin asset previewer will be loaded as usual.
