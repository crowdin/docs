When you're ready to share your app, you can submit your app to the [Crowdin Store](https://store.crowdin.com). Once published, your app will become accessible for installation and usage by other Crowdin users. But before publishing an app, you need to obtain an author account in the Crowdin Store. To do that, [contact our customer success service](https://crowdin.com/contacts) and follow the provided instructions.

## Creating Author Page

Every developer that publishes apps in the Crowdin Store will have a personal author page.

Here is an example of the author page: [Crowdin](https://store.crowdin.com/author/5).

Once you obtain your author account, you can proceed to your author page creation. To do that, navigate to the [Authors management page](https://developer.app.crowdin.net/admin/content/author) and click **Create Item**. You'll need to provide some information for your author page. We recommend doing this before you start the publishing process.

In the table below, you can check out the fields that need to be filled for your author page.

| Field        | Description                                                                                                                                                      | Required |

| Logo         | The Author's logo. We recommend using a .png image with a minimum resolution of 256×256 pixels with a transparent background.                                    | yes      |
| Description  | Add a brief description of up to 200 characters.                                                                                                                 | yes      |
| Support URL  | This can be a link to a support page.                                                                                                                            | yes      |

| Name         | Author's display name.                                                                                                                                           | yes      |

## Preparing App Page

Every app published in the Crowdin Store will have its own app page. This allows other Crowdin users to find and install your app. To start creating an app page, navigate to the [Item management page](https://developer.app.crowdin.net/admin/content/Item) and click **Create Item**. You'll need to provide some information for your app page. We recommend doing this before you start the publishing process.

In the table below, you can check out the fields that need to be filled for your app page.

### App Types

The app type list:

### App Pricing

The pricing field describes the app's pricing model in JSON format. It is used only for rendering pricing info on an app page. You should also implement the behavior in your app.

If your app is free, just leave the empty array `[]` in the pricing field. If your app is paid, click **Fill with Template value** and adjust the pricing description.

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "plan_type": "recurring",
    "price": {
      "monthly": "80",
      "yearly": "800",
      "currency": "USD"
    },
    "trial": true
  }
]
```

Where:

| Field <div class="w-28"/> | Description                                                                                                                               |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `plan_type`               | The type of app's plan. Possible values: `recurring` and `free`.                                                                          |
| `price`                   | The price of the app. Should contain an object with the `monthly` or/and `yearly` value. Available `currency` values are "USD" and "EUR". |
| `trial`                   | Defines if the application has a trial period. By default it's 14 days for crowdin.com and 30 days for Crowdin Enterprise.                |

## App Review Process

The application needs to go through the review process before Crowdin can list it in the Crowdin Store. The review process includes reviewing the author's and app's descriptions on the respective pages in the Crowdin Store.

### Author Verification

You can request author verification for your organization. A **Verified author** badge is a check that appears next to the author account name in the Crowdin Store and means Crowdin has confirmed that an author account is the authentic presence of the company or individual it represents.

To request an author verification, [contact our customer success service](https://crowdin.com/contacts), and we will agree on the further steps.
