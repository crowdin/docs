Managing organization members in Crowdin Enterprise includes assigning project roles, granting admin or manager access, adding users to teams, contacting them, and more.

## Viewing and Searching Users

Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Users** on the left sidebar to view and manage the list of organization members in the **Users** tab. The list displays each user's name, team, status, 2FA status, joining date, and last seen.

The **Status** column can show the following statuses:

* **Active**: The user is an active member of the organization.
* **Pending**: The user has been invited but has not yet accepted the invitation.
* **Blocked**: The user's access to the organization has been revoked.

The **2FA Status** column indicates whether a user has enabled two-factor authentication:

* <Icon name="material-symbols:encrypted" class="inline-icon" /> **Enrolled**: 2FA is enabled.
* <Icon name="material-symbols:warning" class="inline-icon" /> **Not enrolled**: 2FA is disabled.

To filter users, click <Icon name="mdi:filter-variant" class="inline-icon" /> and use the available filter options:

* Organization role: All, Admin, Manager, Vendor, Client.
* Status: All, Active, Pending, Blocked.
* Team: All, specific team.
* Projects: All, specific project.
* Project role: All, Manager, Developer, Translator, Proofreader, Language Coordinator, Member.
* Languages: All, specific language.
* Last seen: Any date, custom range.
* 2FA: All, Two-factor authentication enabled, Two-factor authentication disabled.

Use the **Search** field to find users by name or username.

Click a column heading (e.g., **Name** or **Last seen**) once or twice to toggle ascending or descending order.

## Viewing User Profiles

To view and manage user profiles, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Users** on the left sidebar.
  2. Click on the user or right-click and select **Profile** from the context menu.
</Steps>

The **User details** page opens, providing comprehensive information and management options. The page consists of two main sections:

* **The User info panel** on the left provides a concise summary of the user's profile and key settings:
    * **User Identity**: Shows the user's profile picture, first and last name, username, and email. Click the copy icon to copy the email address. An envelope icon allows you to contact the user directly. An **Owner** or **Admin** plate is displayed for relevant roles.
    * **Permissions**: Contains toggles to manage the user's status and access levels, including **Admin**, **Admin access**, and **Workspace manager**.
    * **2FA Methods**: Displays the user's configured two-factor authentication methods (e.g., **Authenticator App**, **Device verification**). From here, you can also **Reset 2FA** for the user.
    * **Login Methods**: Shows the methods the user can use to sign in (e.g., **Email/Username and Password**, **SAML**, **OpenID Connect**).
    * **Authorized Apps**: Lists the Crowdin apps authorized by the user.
    * **Teams**: Shows the teams the user is a member of. You can click **Add to team** to assign the user to a new team. If the user is not part of any team, "Not a team member" will be displayed.
    * **User Data**: Includes details like **Joined** date, **Last activity**, **Pronouns**, **Local time**, number of **Personal access tokens**, and **Method of registration**.
* **The Management Tabs** on the right allow you to manage the user's specific activities:
    * **Projects and Roles**: Add, edit, clear, or delete project permissions.
    * **Groups**: (Only in [Permission Granularity](/enterprise/permissions-granularity-mode/#permissions) mode) View and manage the groups the user manages.
    * **Contribution**: View and delete the user's contributions across the organization.
    * **Profile**: View and edit the user's first name, last name, pronouns, and time zone.

## Managing User Permissions

You can manage user permissions, such as project roles and organization-level access, for one or more users at once directly from the **Users** page.

<Steps>
  1. Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Users** on the left sidebar.
  2. Select the checkbox for one or more users.
  3. Access the management options in one of two ways:
      * Click the **Permissions** dropdown menu in the upper-right corner.
      * Right-click on the selected users to open the context menu.
  4. Select the desired action:
      * **Add projects permissions** or **Remove projects permissions**. You can manage permissions for multiple projects at once: assign the Manager and Developer roles when adding permissions, or remove permissions for any role.
      * **Enable admin access** or **Disable admin access**.
      * **Block** or **Unblock**.
</Steps>

You can also manage a user's permissions directly from their **User details** page. Organization-level permissions (like **Admin access**) can be set using the toggles in the **User info** panel, while project-specific roles are managed in the **Projects and Roles** tab.

## Resetting a User's 2FA

  1. They are redirected to a confirmation page.
  2. On the confirmation page, they are required to click **Confirm** to deactivate their current 2FA setup.
  3. After confirmation, they can log in to their Crowdin Enterprise account without 2FA.
  4. They can re-enable 2FA at any time from their **Account Settings**.
</Steps>
