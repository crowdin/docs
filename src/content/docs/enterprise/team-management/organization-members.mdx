Managing organization members in Crowdin Enterprise includes assigning project roles, granting admin or manager access, adding users to teams, contacting them, and more.

## Viewing and Searching Users

Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Users** on the left sidebar to view and manage the list of organization members in the **Users** tab. The list displays each user's name, team, status, joining date, and last activity.

To filter users, click <Icon name="mdi:filter-variant" class="inline-icon" /> and use the available filter options:

* Organization role: All, Admin, Manager, Vendor, Client.
* Status: All, Active, Pending, Blocked.
* Team: All, specific team.
* Projects: All, specific project.
* Project role: All, Manager, Developer, Translator, Proofreader, Language Coordinator, Member.
* Languages: All, specific language.
* Last seen: Any date, custom range.
* 2FA: All, Two-factor authentication enabled, Two-factor authentication disabled.

Use the **Search** field to find users by name or username.

Click a column heading (e.g., **Name** or **Last seen**) once or twice to toggle ascending or descending order.
