Managing organization users in Crowdin Enterprise involves various operations such as managing permissions, adding to teams, contacting users, and deleting users. Below you can find instructions for each operation.

## Viewing and Searching Users

You can view the list of organization users (one user per row) with the following details:

By default, all users are displayed in the **Users** tab. To filter users displayed, click <Icon name="mdi:filter-variant" class="inline-icon" /> and use the available filter options:

* Project role: All, Manager, Developer, Translator, Proofreader, Language Coordinator, Member.
* Languages: All, particular language.
* Last seen: Any date, custom range.

To search for a particular user, type their first name, last name, or username in the **Search** field.

To change the sorting order, click once or twice on one of the following column headings:
