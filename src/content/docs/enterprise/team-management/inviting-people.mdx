This guide explains how to invite users either to your organization or directly to specific projects. You'll learn how to assign appropriate roles and permissions depending on the invitation method and where to manage invited users.

## Inviting People to the Organization

When inviting people to your organization, you can either grant them admin or workspace manager access right away or add them without workspace permissions and define their access later. Once added, users can be invited to specific projects or assigned to workflow steps. Note that crowdsourcing projects are automatically visible to all organization members.

<Aside>
  Organization [Security settings](/enterprise/privacy/#security-options) such as **Allow Signup** and **Admin-Managed Invitations** define how users can join the organization and who can invite them.
</Aside>

To invite users to your organization, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Users** on the left sidebar.
  1. In the **Users** tab, click **Invite users** in the lower-right corner. <Image src={addUsers} alt="Add organization user" />
  1. Specify the email addresses of the people you want to invite.
  1. *(Optional)* Select **Admin** or **Workspace manager** to grant the invitees the required permissions.
  1. *(Optional)* Enter a message text if necessary.
  1. Click **Send invite**. <Image src={inviteOrganizationUser} alt="Send invitation to Organization" class="width-xl" />
</Steps>

Once a user joins your organization, you can manage their permissions, track their contributions, update profile information, monitor their last activity, grant admin and workspace manager access, or block the user if necessary.

## Inviting People to a Project

You can invite people directly to a project and grant them the required permissions by assigning roles. If the invited person is not yet an organization member, they will be added to the organization automatically.

To invite members to a specific project, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and select **Members** on the left sidebar.
  1. Click **Invite People** in the upper-right corner. <Image src={inviteProjectUser} alt="Add project member" />
  1. Select from current organization members or type the email address of the person you need to invite. You can also copy the shareable link and send it via email directly.
  1. Define the [permissions](/enterprise/roles/) for an invitee. By default, **Access to all project languages** is enabled. Disable it if you want to grant access to specific languages or workflow steps.
  1. Click **Invite**. <Image src={projectPermissions} alt="Sent invitation to Project" />
</Steps>
