This guide will walk you through the steps to invite users, whether you’re adding them to your organization or specific projects, ensuring they have the appropriate access to contribute effectively.

## Inviting People to the Organization

When inviting people to your organization, you can choose whether to immediately grant them admin or workspace manager permissions or add them with no access to the workspace and configure their permissions later. An exception is crowdsourcing projects, which are visible to all organization members. Once you invite people to the organization, you can then invite them to specific projects or assign them to workflow steps.

To invite users to your organization, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Users** on the left sidebar.
  1. In the **Users** tab, click **Invite users** in the lower-right corner. <Image src={addUsers} alt="Add organization user" />
  1. Specify the email addresses of the people you want to invite.
  1. *(Optional)* Select **Admin** or **Workspace manager** to grant the invitees the required permissions.
  1. *(Optional)* Enter a message text if necessary. 
  1. Click **Send invite**. <Image src={inviteOrganizationUser} alt="Send invitation to Organization" class="width-xl" />
</Steps>

Once a user joins your organization, you can manage their permissions, track their contributions, update profile information, monitor their last activity, grant admin and workspace manager access, or block the user if necessary.

## Inviting People to a Project

You can add members within the project and define their access permissions by assigning them a role.

To invite members to a specific project, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to the **Members** tab.
  1. Click **Invite People** in the upper-right corner. <Image src={inviteProjectUser} alt="Add project member" />
  1. Select from current organization members or type the email address of the person you need to invite. You can also copy the shareable link and send it via email directly.  
  1. Define the [permissions](/enterprise/roles) for an invitee. By default, **Access to all project languages** is enabled. Disable it if you want to grant access to specific languages or workflow steps.
  1. Сlick **Invite**. <Image src={projectPermissions} alt="Sent invitation to Project" />
