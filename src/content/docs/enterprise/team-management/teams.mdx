Organize members of your organization into teams to simplify people management in projects, workflow steps, and tasks.

Teams help you invite tens or even hundreds of members to the project in a few clicks. So inviting a team to the project becomes as easy as inviting a single person.

## Use Cases

* Create language-specific teams of members. You'll be able to assign a whole team to the needed target language on the workflow steps of your projects.
* Assign teams to translation or proofreading tasks. 
* Add a member to the team to automatically grant access to all projects the team participates in.

## Creating Teams

To create a team, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Users** on the left sidebar.
  1. Switch to the **Teams** tab.

## Managing Teams

Managing organization teams in Crowdin Enterprise involves various operations such as managing permissions and team members, contacting teams, and deleting teams. Below you can find instructions for each operation.

### Viewing and Searching Teams

## Assigning Teams

### Assigning Teams to Workflow Step

You can assign a team to the workflow step of your project in the workflow editor or the Workflow template editor.

### Inviting Teams to the Project

You can invite a team to the project via the **Members** tab and provide the necessary access level the same way as you do it for a single person.

  Read more about [inviting people to the project](/enterprise/inviting-people/#inviting-people-to-project).
</ReadMore>

After you invited a team to the project, you can remove one or few people from the project members list. In this case, the deleted member will remain in the team and on next invitations to the projects will be listed among project participants.

### Assigning Team to the Task

While creating a translation or proofreading task, you can assign it to the team. Optionally, you can use the *Split files* option to split translatable content between team members.

## Team Permissions

When you invite an individual member to a project who also participates in a team, and later on, you invite this team to the project as well, the personal permissions of this member might be overridden by the team permissions. For example, if the member initially had permissions only for the translation step of French, and then the whole team was granted permissions for the translation and proofreading steps of French, German, and Italian, this particular member will also receive the higher permissions.
