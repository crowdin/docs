Roles in Crowdin Enterprise define the level of access and control users have within the platform. By assigning roles, you can manage user permissions across the Editor, project settings, and organization settings.

Below you can find descriptions of each role and its associated permissions.

## Owner

Owner is the user who created the organization and has complete control over it. The owner can invite users to the organization and manage their access, configure organization settings, manage vendors, create projects and groups, work with source and translation files, set up integrations, and more.

<Aside>
  Only the owner can delete the organization or transfer ownership to another user.

## Admin

Admin has similar rights to the organization owner, with full access to the organization, including inviting and managing users, configuring organization settings, and creating and managing projects and groups. Admin can’t delete the organization or transfer ownership.

**Use case:** Suitable for trusted team members who need full access to manage the organization, its projects, and settings, without the ability to delete the organization.

## Manager

Manager has a more focused scope of control that depends on their assignment at various levels. Based on the [Permission granularity](/enterprise/permissions-granularity-mode/#permissions) settings, Managers can be assigned at the organization, group, subgroup, or project levels. They inherit access to all child entities within their assigned parent entity (i.e., organization, group, or subgroup). Managers can't manage vendors, invite or manage users at the organization level, or configure organization settings.

### Workspace Manager

Workspace Manager can create and manage projects across the entire organization (including inviting people to projects and managing resources). They also have access to all groups and subgroups.

**Use case:** Suitable for users responsible for maintaining consistency across multiple projects in the organization.

If permission granularity is disabled, Workspace Manager can be assigned using the **Workspace manager** toggle in the **User details**. If enabled, the organization's workspace is treated as a root group, and the role is granted by assigning the user to manage the root group from the **Groups** tab in the **User details**.

### Group Manager

Group Manager can create and manage projects within a specific group (including inviting people to projects and managing resources). They also inherit manager access to all subgroups within the assigned group.

**Use case:** Suitable for users responsible for managing a group of projects and ensuring consistency within that group.

Group managers can be assigned only when permission granularity is enabled. In that case, organization owners and admins can assign users to manage specific groups or subgroups from the **Groups** tab in the **User details**.

### Project Manager

Project Managers are responsible for the management of individual projects. Within those projects, they can manage project members, tasks, and resources, etc., but do not have access to settings or resources outside of their assigned projects.

**Use case:** Suitable for users who need to focus only on managing specific projects without broader organizational responsibilities.

### Developer

Developer can upload source files, edit translatable text, connect integrations, and access the API. They don’t have permissions to manage project members, tasks, or reports.

**Use case:** Suitable for users handling the technical aspects of localization, such as file management, integration setup, or automation.

### Language Coordinator

Language Coordinator can manage certain project features only for their assigned languages. They can translate and approve strings, manage project members and teams, generate project reports, create tasks, and pre-translate content. Language Coordinators cannot access other project settings such as source files, integrations, or project configurations.

**Use case:** Suitable for users coordinating translations across specific project languages.


## Contributor

Contributor is a general term for both Translators and Proofreaders who primarily work in the Editor. They can view projects, tasks, and workflow steps they are assigned to, access the Editor on corresponding workflow steps, generate personal translation reports, and communicate with other project members.

### Proofreader

Proofreader can translate and approve strings within assigned projects. They do not have access to project settings or management functions.

**Use case:** Suitable for users focused on finalizing translations and ensuring quality.

### Translator

Translator can add translations and vote on suggestions made by others. They do not have the ability to approve translations or access project settings.

**Use case:** Suitable for users responsible for providing translations without additional management responsibilities.

## Vendor

Vendors are separate organizations that provide professional translation services. After you invite a vendor to your project, their organization receives a copy of the assigned workflow step in the *Incoming Projects* section of their workspace. This setup is commonly used when outsourcing translations to external teams while keeping the workflow and quality control within Crowdin Enterprise.
