Managing project members in Crowdin Enterprise involves various operations such as managing permissions, contacting members, and deleting members. Below you can find instructions for each operation.

* Language: All, particular language.
* Workflow step: All, particular step.
* Exclude inherited managers: No, Yes.
* Last seen: All, Custom range.

To search for a particular member, type their first name, last name, or username in the **Search** field.

To change the sorting order, click once or twice on one of the following column headings:
