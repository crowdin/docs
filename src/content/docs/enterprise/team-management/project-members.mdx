Roles define what project members can do based on their responsibilities and assigned languages. Project owners, admins, and managers can invite new members, assign roles, and manage their permissions. Language Coordinators can also manage members within their assigned languages, including inviting Translators and Proofreaders.

## Viewing and Searching Project Members

Open your project and select **Members** on the left sidebar to view and manage the list of project members. The list displays each member's name, role, team, and the date they were granted access to the project. The **Members** tab is selected by default. You can switch to the **Teams** tab to view and manage project teams instead.

To filter members, click <Icon name="mdi:filter-variant" class="inline-icon" /> and use the available filter options:

* Role: All, Translation Requestor / Developer, Translator, Proofreader, Language Coordinator, Member, Manager, Admin, Vendor, Client.
* Language: All, specific language.
* Workflow step: All, specific step.
* Exclude inherited managers: No, Yes.
* Last seen: All, Custom range.

Use the **Search** field to find members by name or username.

Click a column heading (e.g., **Name** or **Given access**) once or twice to toggle ascending or descending order.

For Translator, Proofreader, and Language Coordinator roles, if no specific languages or workflow steps are selected during the invitation, the member receives access to all target languages and steps by default.
