Crowdin Enterprise subscription plans are billed annually. Annual plans are purchased in one payment, which is then assessed as an account balance. Crowdin Enterprise withdraws from this balance a corresponding amount each billing cycle.

As the number of your managers and hosted words can change over time, you can upgrade or downgrade at any point. The price of your previous annual plan is prorated and applied against the cost of your new subscription once the new monthly billing cycle starts.

For example, if you make an annual payment for the Business plan and downgrade to the Team+ plan, your credit will last longer than a year.
Likewise, if you purchase Team+ and upgrade to Business over time, the credit may run out in less than a year.

As the annual subscription doesn't renew automatically, we will send you a reminder that your current subscription expires soon once your account balance goes below two months. To continue using Crowdin, it would be necessary to purchase a new subscription.

If you have active Crowdin app subscriptions, they will be represented in the downloaded invoice along with the primary Crowdin Enterprise subscription.
