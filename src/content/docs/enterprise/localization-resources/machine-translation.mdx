Machine translation engines integrated with Crowdin Enterprise provide translation suggestions from services like Google Translate and AutoML Translation, Microsoft Translate, and others.

MT suggestions are displayed in the Editor’s TM and MT Suggestions section in the order of the engines' configuration dates. To prioritize a specific engine's suggestions, configure that engine first.

Also, you can perform [Pre-Translation](/enterprise/pre-translation/) using MT engines.

By default, machine translations are enabled for each project, but it is required to configure the translation engines before the project members can use them. If you want to disable this option for specific projects, clear **Show machine translation suggestions** in [Project Settings](/enterprise/project-settings/machine-translation/).

To configure the machine translation engines, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Machine translation** on the left sidebar.
  2. At the bottom right, click <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" />**Add MT Engine**.
  3. In the appeared dialog, select an engine from the drop-down list.
  4. *(Optional)* Edit the name of the MT Engine if needed.
  5. Enter the requested credentials.
  6. *(Optional)* Select applicable languages. Alternatively, leave empty for access to all languages.
  7. *(Optional)* Select projects in which you want to use the MT engine. Alternatively, leave empty to enable it for all organization projects.
  8. Click **Create**.
</Steps>

### Microsoft Translator

Go to [Windows Azure](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/HubsExtension/BrowseAll) to access your Microsoft Translator API subscription key. Translator Text API offers a free tier with 2,000,000 translated characters.

<Aside>
  If the *Resource Location* associated with your Microsoft Translator Text API key is other than *global*, please make sure to specify it along with other credentials while configuring the Microsoft Translator MT engine in your Crowdin account.

### DeepL Translator

DeepL API is accessible only with the DeepL API Free and Pro subscription plans ([For developers](https://www.deepl.com/pro.html#developer) tab). Navigate to the [DeepL Pro Account page](https://www.deepl.com/pro-account.html) to get a unique Authentication Key. Please note that the DeepL API plan is the only plan that provides this feature.

If you’re subscribed to a different subscription plan, you can switch to the DeepL API plan in your [personal account settings](https://www.deepl.com/pro-account.html). DeepL also provides a [simulator](https://www.deepl.com/docs-api/simulator) that allows you to check your Authentication Key in action.

### ModernMT

ModernMT Real time translation API is accessible with the Real time or Human-in-the-loop subscription plans. Navigate to the [ModernMT Dashboard](https://www.modernmt.com/dashboard/) to get your License key. If you’re subscribed to a different subscription plan, you can switch to the Real time or Human-in-the-loop plan via the [Manage Plan](https://www.modernmt.com/dashboard/manage-plan) page.

### Amazon Translate

The free version of Amazon Translate is available for 12 months. Afterward, you will need to pay for the number of characters translated. Crowdin uses Standard Text Translation type provided by Amazon Translate. Read more about [available Amazon Translate pricing options](https://aws.amazon.com/translate/pricing/).

Read more about [obtaining your access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-sec-cred-types.html#access-keys-and-secret-access-keys) needed for Amazon Translate integration.

To use your [Custom Terminology](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/how-custom-terminology.html), follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Specify your AWS Region (e.g., us-east-2).
  2. Select your Custom Terminology from the respective drop-down menu.
</Steps>

<QuestionAnswer title="What are the minimal scopes for an IAM user required to set up Amazon Translate to be used in Crowdin?">
  The minimal IAM scopes required depend on whether you're using terminologies or not:

  **Without terminologies:**

  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "translate:TranslateText",
        "Resource": "*"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  **With terminologies:**

  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": [
          "translate:TranslateText",
          "translate:GetTerminology",
          "translate:ListTerminologies"
        ],
        "Resource": "*"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  Alternatively, you can use the [AWS managed policy: TranslateReadOnly](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/translate/latest/dg/security-iam-awsmanpol.html#security-iam-awsmanpol-TranslateReadOnly), which provides the necessary read-only access to Amazon Translate.

  <Aside>The `"Resource": "*"` allows access to all resources. For stricter security, consider limiting this to specific AWS regions or resources if applicable.</Aside>

#### Google Cloud AutoML Custom Glossary Configuration

Google Cloud AutoML custom glossary allows you to translate your domain-specific terminology consistently. You can use only one Google Cloud AutoML custom model at once. If you have multiple custom models you'd like to use in your Crowdin Enterprise projects, create multiple instances of Google Cloud AutoML MT engine under your Crowdin Enterprise account, specifying the different models in the settings of each MT engine. During the pre-translation via MT, you can alternately use Google Cloud AutoML with the needed model.

To configure your Google Cloud AutoML custom glossary, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Machine translation** on the left sidebar.
  2. At the bottom right, click <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" />**Add MT Engine**.
  3. In the appeared dialog, select **Google AutoML Translate** from the **Engine** drop-down list.
  4. Click **Select file** and upload your JSON credentials.
  5. *(Optional)* Specify your Custom Model. <Aside>If no Google Cloud AutoML custom model is specified in the MT engine settings, the Google NMT model will be used instead.</Aside>
  6. Specify your Resource location (e.g., us-central1).
  7. Select your Glossary from the respective drop-down list.
  8. *(Optional)* Configure language mapping between Custom Model and Crowdin languages.
  9. *(Optional)* Select applicable languages. Alternatively, leave empty for access to all languages.
  10. *(Optional)* Select projects in which you want to use the MT engine. Alternatively, leave empty to enable it for all organization projects.
  11. Click **Create**.
</Steps>

## MT Engine IDs

Once you specify your MT engine credentials, the system automatically assigns a unique MT engine ID. Later on, you can use these IDs in API requests for pre-translation via machine engines.

You can find the MT engine ID in the organization's **Workspace > Machine translation** page.
Alternatively, you can also [get your MT engine IDs via API](/developer/enterprise/api/v2/#tag/Machine-Translation-Engines/operation/api.mts.getMany).

## Clearing MT Engine Cache

When MT engines are updated with new features or models, cached translations in Crowdin Enterprise may no longer reflect the latest translation capabilities. To display updated translations in the Editor’s **TM and MT Suggestions** section, clear the MT engine cache. This can be especially useful if you've already viewed certain strings in the Editor, as Crowdin Enterprise stores cached MT suggestions for those strings.

To clear the cache for your configured MT engine, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Machine translation** on the left sidebar.
  1. Click <Icon name="mdi:dots-vertical" class="inline-icon" /> (or right-click) on the needed MT engine in the list.
  1. Click **Clear cache**.
</Steps>
