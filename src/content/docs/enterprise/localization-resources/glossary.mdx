With a glossary, you can create, store, and manage all the project terminology in one place. The main aim of terminology is to explain some specific terms or the ones often used in the project to be translated properly and consistently.

Each glossary term is displayed as an underlined word in the Editor. Hover over the underlined term to highlight it and see its translation, part of speech, and definition (if they are provided).

## Creating Glossary

In addition to the project glossaries that are automatically created with each project, you can create separate glossaries and populate them with content by uploading your existing glossaries in TBX, XLSX, or CSV format. These glossaries can then be assigned to the relevant projects as needed.

To create a glossary, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Glossaries** on the left sidebar.
  2. At the bottom right, click <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon"/>**Create**. <Image src={createGlossary} alt="Create glossary" />
  3. In the appeared dialog, name your glossary and select a default language that will be displayed first in the table of glossary records.
  4. *(Optional)* Click **Select files** to upload your existing glossary. You can skip this step and upload a glossary later.
  5. Click **Create**. <Image src={createGlossaryDialog} alt="Create glossary dialog" class="width-lg" />
</Steps>

## Managing Glossary Concepts and Terms

Depending on your project needs, you can use a simpler approach with one term per language or make your glossary more detailed and complete using the advanced functionality that glossary concepts can offer.

### Creating Glossary Concepts and Terms

Concept &ndash; the highest-level terminology element that contains concept-level data (e.g., concept definition, subject, etc.), including language-level (i.e., term language) and term-level data (e.g., term, the term's part of speech, type, etc.). Simply put, a concept incorporates glossary terms and their variations with multiple translations and other relevant information.

You can specify the following concept and term details when adding glossary concepts.

Concept details:

* Definition &ndash; A clear explanation of the concept's meaning.
* Subject &ndash; A branch of knowledge the concept is related to.
* Translatable &ndash; Specifies whether the concept could be translated into other languages.
* Note &ndash; Short notes about a concept that might be helpful to translators.
* URL &ndash; URL to the web page with relevant information about a concept.
* Figure &ndash; URL to the relevant image.

Term details:

* Term &ndash; Specific word or phrase that is being defined.
* Language &ndash; Specifies the language of the term.
* Part of speech &ndash; e.g., noun, verb, adjective, etc.
* Type &ndash; Classifies the term's function (e.g., full form, acronym, abbreviation, phrase, variant).
* Status &ndash; Defines the term's approval level (e.g., preferred, admitted, not recommended).
* Gender &ndash; The grammatical gender of the term (e.g., masculine, feminine, neuter).
* Description &ndash; A brief explanation or context for the specific term (distinct from the concept's definition).
* Note &ndash; Short notes about a term that might be helpful to translators.
* URL &ndash; URL to the web page with relevant information about a term.

To add a new glossary concept, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Glossaries** on the left sidebar. Alternatively, open your project and go to **Settings > Glossaries**.
  2. Click on the needed glossary.
  3. Click **Add concept**. <Image src={addConcept} alt="Add Concept" />
  4. In the appeared dialog, select the language from the drop-down menu, and specify the term and all related details. Click <Icon name="mdi:auto-fix" class="inline-icon"/> to detect the part of speech automatically.
      <Aside>
        Part of speech can be automatically detected only for the following languages: English, French, Spanish, German, Norwegian, Polish, Swedish, Russian, Italian, and Chinese.
      </Aside>
  5. *(Optional)* Click **Add term** to add a term variation (e.g., acronym, short form, etc.)
  6. Specify the concept details.
  7. Click **Create**. <Image src={addConceptDialog} alt="Add Concept Dialog" />
</Steps>

To add glossary concepts via the Editor, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. In the Editor, select the needed word in the source string.
  2. In the appeared menu, select **Create Term**. Alternatively, you can use the keyboard shortcut to add a concept (by default, <KBD>Ctrl</KBD>+<KBD>G</KBD>). <Image src={addConceptEditor} alt="Add Concept in Editor" />
  3. Follow the steps described in the section above.
</Steps>

To allow translators and proofreaders to manage terms in the Editor, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Settings > Privacy**.
  2. In the [**Glossary Access Settings**](/enterprise/project-settings/privacy/#glossary-access-settings) section, select the preferred access level for project members.
</Steps>

You can choose to allow them to manage only draft terms. When a project member adds a draft term, project managers can filter terms by draft status, review them, and make necessary modifications or add glossary concept details.

Alternatively, you can grant full access, allowing them to manage all glossary terms and concept details with the same level of control as the project owner and managers.

Enhance terminology consistency across your project by setting up AI Alignment. This feature automatically generates draft glossary terms based on translations suggested by human translators, helping maintain preferred terminology.

### Viewing, Searching, and Filtering Glossary Concepts and Terms

Once you open a glossary, you can view and filter its glossary concepts and terms using either the **Concepts** or **Terms** tabs.

On the **Concepts** tab, you can view glossary content grouped as concepts (one concept per row, each term displayed in a separate language column).

<Image src={conceptsView} alt="Concepts View" />

On the **Terms** tab, you can view glossary content as individual terms (one term per row) with the following details:

* **Term**: Contains either source or target language text.
* **Language**: The term's language (e.g., French, Spanish).
* **Part of speech**: The term's grammatical category (e.g., noun, verb).
* **Type**: The term's classification (e.g., full form, acronym).
* **Status**: The term's approval level (e.g., preferred, admitted).
* **Gender**: The term's grammatical gender (e.g., masculine, feminine).
* **Description (context)**: The specific description for that term.
* **Note**: Any additional note for that term.
* **Concept subject**: The subject field from the parent concept.
* **Concept definition**: The definition from the parent concept.

<Image src={termsView} alt="Terms View" />

By default, all glossary concepts and terms are displayed. To find a specific concept or term, you can use the **Search** field.

In the **Concepts** tab, you can search by the following details:

* **Terms**
* **Concept definitions**
* **Concept subjects**

To refine the search results, you can use the following options:

* **Match case**
* **Match whole phrase**
* **Exact match**

To filter the list of concepts or terms, click **Filter** <Icon name="mdi:filter-variant" class="inline-icon" /> and use the available options:

* **Languages** (Specific to the **Terms** tab): Filter by **All languages** or a **Specific language**.
* **Modified**: Filter by modification date (**All**, **Custom Range**).
* **Part of speech**: Filter by grammatical category (**All**, **Noun**, **Verb**, etc.).
* **Type**: Filter by classification (**All**, **Full form**, **Acronym**, etc.).
* **Status**: Filter by approval status (**All**, **Preferred**, **Draft**, etc.).
* **Gender**: Filter by grammatical gender (**All**, **Masculine**, **Feminine**, etc.).
* **Author**: Filter by **All** or a particular user.

To sort concepts or terms, click **Sort by** and select one of the available options:

* **Text**
* **Date modified**
* **Date created**

To customize your viewing experience, you can use the following options on the top toolbar:

* **Word Wrap**: Click <Icon name="mdi:wrap" class="inline-icon" /> to toggle the word wrap feature. This is useful for viewing long texts (such as definitions, subjects, or notes) without expanding the column width.
* **Column Settings**: Click <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon" /> to configure which columns are displayed in the table.
  * **Concepts** page: You can show or hide columns like *Definition*, *Subject*, *Translatable*, and *Note*.
  * **Terms** page: You can show or hide columns like *Language*, *Part of speech*, *Type*, *Status*, *Gender*, *Description (context)*, *Note*, *Concept subject*, and *Concept definition*.

### Editing Glossary Concepts and Terms

You can edit existing glossary concepts of a particular glossary.

To edit a glossary concept, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Glossaries** on the left sidebar. Alternatively, open your project and go to **Settings > Glossaries**.
  2. Click on the needed glossary.
  3. Hover over a glossary concept and click <Icon name="mdi:pencil" class="inline-icon" /> to open it.
  4. In the appeared dialog, make the necessary edits to the concept or terms and click **Save**. <Image src={editConcept} alt="Edit Glossary Concept" />
</Steps>

### Deleting Glossary Concepts

You can delete one, multiple, or all the glossary concepts at once.

To delete all the concepts from the glossary, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Select the top checkbox above the concept list.
  2. Confirm the selection of all concepts.
  3. Click <Icon name="mdi:delete" class="inline-icon"/>. <Image src={deleteAllConcepts} alt="Deleting Glossary Concepts" />
</Steps>

## Managing Glossaries

You can manage your glossaries directly from the **Glossaries** page in your Workspace. This includes uploading and downloading content, editing glossary details, clearing glossary data, assigning glossaries to projects, and deleting them.

To access these management options, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Glossaries** on the left sidebar.
  2. Click <Icon name="mdi:dots-vertical" class="inline-icon" /> (or right-click) on the needed glossary to open the context menu.
</Steps>

Alternatively, you can access the **Edit glossary**, **Clear glossary**, and **Delete glossary** options from within a specific glossary by clicking <Icon name="mdi:dots-vertical" class="inline-icon" /> in the top-right corner of the **Concepts** page.

### Uploading and Downloading Glossary

You can upload existing glossaries to Crowdin Enterprise or download your glossary content for backup, editing, or other purposes outside Crowdin Enterprise. Glossaries can be downloaded in full or with applied filters, which is useful when you want to export only a subset of glossary concepts that meet specific criteria (e.g., by subject, status, or language).

To upload or download the glossary, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Glossaries** on the left sidebar. Alternatively, open your project and go to **Settings > Glossaries**.
  2. Click on the needed glossary.
  3. Click <Icon name="mdi:swap-vertical" class="inline-icon" /> and select one of the following options:
      * **Upload** – uploads new glossary content.
      * **Download** – downloads the full glossary.
      * **Download filtered** – downloads only glossary concepts that match the applied filters or search criteria. <Image src={downloadUpload} alt="Downloading and Uploading Glossary" />
</Steps>

The owner, admins, and managers can upload and download the glossary in the following file formats: TBX (v2), TBX (v3), CSV, XLSX.

<Aside type="caution" title="Limitations">
  The maximum file size is 100 MB. If your file exceeds this limit, it is recommended to split it into several smaller files and upload them one at a time.
</Aside>

If you upload a glossary in CSV or XLS/XLSX file formats, select the language for each column and the column value (term, description, or part of speech) in the configuration dialog.

<Image src={configureImport} alt="Configure Glossary Import" class="crowdin-modal" />

<Aside>
  Parts of speech are supported in the following format (case-insensitive): adjective, adposition, adverb, auxiliary, coordinating conjunction, determiner, interjection, noun, numeral, particle, pronoun, proper noun, subordinating conjunction, verb, other.
</Aside>

When downloading a glossary from Crowdin Enterprise, some browsers may add an XML extension to the downloaded file so that the file may be named *sample.tbx.xml*. To import such a file back to Crowdin Enterprise, rename it to *sample.tbx*.

#### Automatic Column Identification for Glossary in CSV and XLSX File Formats

Once you upload your glossary file in CSV or XLSX formats, the system automatically detects the file scheme based on the column names specified in the first row. The identification is performed in a case-insensitive manner. Columns that weren’t detected automatically will be left as **Not used**/**Not chosen** for manual configuration. Automatic column identification is especially helpful when you upload glossary spreadsheets that contain many languages and additional columns (e.g., Status, Type, Gender, etc.).

To get the most out of the automatic column detection, we recommend that you name the columns in your CSV or XLSX glossary files using the patterns described below:

* Term details &ndash; `{column-type} [{crowdin-language-code}]` (e.g., `Term [en]`, `Description [en]`, `Part of Speech [en]`, etc.).
* Concept details &ndash; `Concept {concept-details-type}` (e.g., `Concept Definition`, `Concept Subject`, `Concept Note`, etc.).

To redetect the glossary file scheme, click **Detect Configuration**.

<Aside>
  The **Do not import the first row (header)** option is automatically selected if the automatic scheme detection identifies all columns in the uploaded glossary file.
</Aside>

### Editing Glossary

You can rename your glossary or change its default language at any time.

To edit a glossary, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Glossaries** on the left sidebar.

## Q&A

<QuestionAnswer title="A client updates a glossary term translation, but the vendor doesn’t see it in the Editor. How it can be fixed?">
  The priority is given to the organization's own glossaries first, followed by external (i.e., client) glossaries. To resolve this, the vendor can disable their own glossary and use only the client's glossary to ensure they see the updated term.
</QuestionAnswer>
