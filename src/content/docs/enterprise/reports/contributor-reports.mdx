As a translator or a proofreader, you can estimate and count the price of your contribution to the project and view your position in the Top Members list. You can also view the progress of the project and track your contributions over a specific period of time. For this, open the project and go to the **Reports** tab.

<Image src={reportsTab} alt="Reports Tab" />

## Project Reports

You can analyze the project data with the following reports:

- [Project size](#project-size)
- [Project summary](#project-summary)

### Project Size

You can find the total number of texts in the project under the *Project Size*. You can also see the numbers of such texts:
- *Translatable* &ndash; for translation
- *Hidden* &ndash; not for translation (visible only for managers)
- *Duplicates* &ndash; repeating within the project

This report might be generated based on the following parameters: words, strings, characters, and characters with spaces.

### Project Summary

The Project Summary section provides a comprehensive visual analysis of the project's translation progress using the following graphs: Translation activity and Proofreading activity.

You can use this report to compare your contribution to overall project activity.

There are four periods available: Last week, Last 30 days, Last 24 hours, and Last year. The graphs are generated based on the text unit type selected for the **Project Size** section.

* **Translation activity:** displays the volume of translated units (words, strings, characters) over time. It displays three lines simultaneously - units translated by human translators, units translated by Translation Memory (TM), and units translated by Machine Translation (MT). By hovering over the data points, you can view daily or monthly totals for each category.

* **Proofreading activity:** displays the approval and voting activities within your project. It shows two lines - approved units and vote quantities, allowing you to see how review activity is trending over time. By hovering over the data points, you can view the daily or monthly number of approved texts and votes.

Each graph allows you to focus on specific data by hovering over elements for more detailed information or by adjusting display settings to highlight or hide certain parameters.

## Cost Estimate

The Cost Estimate report allows you to calculate the approximate price of your contribution (i.e., translation or proofreading) to the project based on all or specific tasks to which you were assigned.

<Aside>
  You can select from tasks with To Do or In Progress status.
</Aside>

Set the translation and approval rates to see the cost for untranslated and not approved strings within selected tasks.

You can generate a Cost Estimate report based on the following filter parameters:

* Tasks: Not selected, All tasks, or a specific task.

<Aside>
  Final translation cost might differ due to various factors such as added or deleted texts, multiple people translating the same string into the same language, and others.
</Aside>

### Generating a Report {#generating-cost-estimate}

To generate the Cost Estimate report, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Select the preferred currency and the report unit (word, string, character, or characters (including spaces)).
  1. Use the available filter parameters to specify the report data you're interested in.
  1. Set your [rates](#rates-cost-estimate) for translations and approvals.
  1. Click **Generate**.
</Steps>

<Image src={costEstimateGenerating} alt="Generating Cost Estimate" />

<Aside>
  Rates are automatically saved after you click *Generate*.
</Aside>

### Rates {#rates-cost-estimate}

You can set the prices for Base rates (full translation, proofread) and configure Net Rate Schemes (percentage of the full translation rate paid for translation using TM suggestions).

#### Base Rates {#base-rates-cost-estimate}

In the Base Rates section, you can set rates for the following types of work:

* **Full translation** &ndash; for each translation made by a person.
  <Aside>If the string has multiple translations made by the same person, only one is counted. If the string has several translations made by different people, each is counted for a specific translator.</Aside>
* **Proofread** &ndash; for each approved translation.

#### Net Rate Schemes {#net-rate-schemes-cost-estimate}

In the Net Rate Schemes section, in addition to the base rates, you can set the percentage of the full translation rate to be paid for translations made using TM suggestions of various TM Match types. By default, you can configure the percentage of the full translation rate for the following TM Match types:

- **101 (perfect)** &ndash; for translations made using Perfect match TM suggestions (source strings are identical to TM suggestion by text and context).
- **100** &ndash; for translations made using 100% match TM suggestions (source strings are identical to TM suggestion only by text).

You can also add your own TM match types, specifying the preferred percentage of text similarity and the percentage of the full translation rate to be paid for such a translation.

To add your own TM match types, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Click <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon" /> in the Net Rate Schemes section.
  1. Click on the appeared <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" /> button.
  1. Specify the TM match range and the percentage of the full translation rate.
  1. Click <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon" /> to save the settings.
</Steps>

<Image src={addTmMatchType} alt="Adding TM Match Type" class="width-lg" />

#### Adding Custom Rates {#custom-rates-cost-estimate}

If you are multilingual and work with different languages, in addition to base rates that are applied to all languages by default, you can add custom rates for specific languages. To add custom rates, click **Add custom rates**.

To select the languages for custom rates, click the drop-down menus and select the ones you need. You can create as many custom rates as you need.

<Image src={addCustomRates} alt="Adding Custom Rates" />

#### Rate Templates

If project managers saved multiple rate configurations, you can use them for report generation. Saved templates allow you to quickly switch between different configurations.

Click **Templates** to view and select saved rate templates.

### Include Pre-translated Strings

Select **Include pre-translated strings** if you want to include pre-translated strings in a Cost Estimate report. By default, this option is selected.

For example, there is an untranslated string `Validate your username` in the project. You generate a Cost Estimate report with the **Include pre-translated strings** option selected. This string will be included in the Cost Estimate. Then a project manager pre-translates this string via TM or MT engine and you once again generate a Cost Estimate report with the **Include pre-translated strings** option selected. This time, the pre-translated string `Validate your username` won't be included in the Cost Estimate report.

On the other hand, with the **Include pre-translated strings** option cleared, the string `Validate your username` will be included in the Cost Estimate report both times, when untranslated and when pre-translated via TM or MT engine.

### Calculate Internal Fuzzy Matches

Internal Fuzzy Matches &ndash; Fuzzy TM matches found among the untranslated strings that potentially can be added to TM. For example, if the first string in the file is `Validate your username`, and the last one is `Validate your username again`, there will be an internal fuzzy match.

To get a more deliberate report that includes a prediction of internal fuzzy matches, select **Calculate Internal Fuzzy Matches**.

This way, all the internal matches would be counted to see how many strings can be added to TM if the strings are translated one by one as listed.
Keep in mind that calculations are approximate because strings might be translated in a different order.

<Aside>
  Internal Fuzzy Matches would be counted according to the Net Rate Schemes configurations.
</Aside>

### Result Analysis {#result-analysis-cost-estimate}

When the report is generated, you will see the following amounts:

* **Total** &ndash; general cost estimate for all languages.
* **Subtotals** &ndash; cost estimate for each language which includes TM savings, translations and proofreading costs.

To download the Cost Estimate report, click **Export** and select the preferred export format (CSV, XLSX, or JSON).

## Top Members

The Top Members report allows you to check your position on the list of project members and see who contributed the most to the project's translation.

Default parameters:
- *Text unit*: words
- *Time period*: Last 30 days
- *Sorted by*: translated text units. A member who translated the most is placed at the top of the list.
- *Languages*: all languages
- *Contributors*: all

Re-sort the members by clicking on the needed parameter. For example, if you are a proofreader, you might want to know who approved most of the strings. For this, click on the *Approved* parameter to redo sorting.

<Image src={topMembersSorted} alt="Top Members" />

### Generating a Custom List of Top Members

To generate a custom list of top members, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Select the preferred report unit (words, strings, characters with or without spaces).
  1. Select the time period for which you want to see the activity of contributors.
  1. To make a list of contributors for a specific language, select the language you need from the drop-down menu above the list. Alternatively, select **All languages**.
</Steps>

To look for your account or account of any other contributor, use the search field.

The Top Members list includes the following columns:

* *Name* &ndash; conributor's first name, last name and username.
* *Languages* &ndash; project languages.
* *Translated* &ndash; the number of translated source content units.
* *Target* &ndash; the number of translated content units in a target language.
<br/> This parameter is not available for the *Strings* content unit because the number of source and translated strings is always the same.
* *Approved* &ndash; the number of approved content units.
* *Voted* &ndash; the number of votes a contributor made.
* *"+" votes received* &ndash; the number of upvotes a contributor received for translations.
* *"-" votes received* &ndash; the number of downvotes a contributor received for translations.
* *Winning* &ndash; the number of approvals a contributor received for translations.
* *Given access* &ndash; indicates when a member was granted access to a project.

To customize the visibility of columns in the report, click <Icon name="material-symbols:table-chart" class="inline-icon" /> at the upper-right side of the table and select the preferred ones.

<Aside>
  The **Export** option for the Top Members report is not available in the Contributor Reports.  
</Aside>

## My Activity

The My Activity report allows you to calculate the price of your contribution (i.e., translation or proofreading) to the project.

You can generate a My Activity report based on the following filter parameters:

* Tasks: Not selected, All Tasks, or specific task.
* Time period: All time, Today, Yesterday, Last 7 days, Last 30 days, or Custom range.
* Workflow step (Specific to [projects with a workflow](/enterprise/creating-project/#projects-with-a-workflow)): All or a specific workflow step.
* Files: All files (including deleted) or Selected files (excluding deleted).
* Language: All or specific target language.
* Labels (Specific to projects with [labels](/enterprise/project-settings/labels)): Not selected, Strings with selected labels, or Strigns without selected labels.

### Generating a Report {#generating-my-activity}

To generate the My Activity report, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Select the preferred currency and the report unit (word, string, character, or characters (including spaces)).
  1. Use the available filter parameters to specify the report data you're interested in.
  1. Set your [rates](#rates-my-activity) for translations and approvals.
  1. Click **Generate**.
</Steps>

<Image src={myActivityGenerating} alt="Generating My Activity" />

<Aside>
  Rates are automatically saved after you click **Generate**.
</Aside>

### Rates {#rates-my-activity}

You can set the prices for Base rates (full translation, proofread) and configure Net Rate Schemes (percentage of the full translation rate paid for translation using TM suggestions, MT suggestions, and existing translations).

#### Base Rates {#base-rates-my-activity}

In the Base Rates section, you can set rates for the following types of work:

* **Full translation** &ndash; for each translation you made.
  <Aside>If the string has multiple translations made by the same person, only one is counted. If the string has several translations made by different people, each is counted for a specific translator.</Aside>
* **Proofread** &ndash; for each approved translation.

#### Net Rate Schemes {#net-rate-schemes-my-activity}

In the Net Rate Schemes section, in addition to the base rates, you can set the percentage of the full translation rate to be paid for translations made using TM suggestions, MT suggestions, and other translations of various Match types.

By default, you can configure the percentage of the full translation rate for the following match type categories:

**TM Match types:**

- **101 (perfect)** &ndash; for translations made using Perfect match TM suggestions (source strings are identical to TM suggestion by text and context).
- **100** &ndash; for translations made using 100% match TM suggestions (source strings are identical to TM suggestion only by text).

**MT Match types:**

- **100** &ndash; for translations made using 100% match MT suggestions (new suggested translations are identical to MT suggestion).

**Other translations types:**

- **100** &ndash; for translations made using existing translations (new suggested translations are identical to the existing translations).

If a string has a combination of TM and MT suggestions and existing translations, the new translation is counted at the lowest Net Rate Scheme value. For example, if a string has a 101% (perfect) TM match suggestion (10% of the full translation rate) and a 100% MT match suggestion (5% of the full translation rate), the new translation added to this string will be counted at a 5% of the full translation rate.

You can also add your own TM, MT, and Other translations match types, specifying the preferred percentage of text similarity and the percentage of the full translation rate to be paid for such a translation.

To add your own match types, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Click <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon" /> in the Net Rate Schemes section.
  1. Click on the appeared <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" /> button.
  1. Specify the match range and the percentage of the full translation rate.
  1. Click <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon" /> to save the settings.
</Steps>

#### Adding Custom Rates {#custom-rates-my-activity}

If you are multilingual and work with different languages, in addition to base rates that are applied to all languages by default, you can add custom rates for specific languages. To add custom rates, click **Add custom rates**.

To select the languages for custom rates, click the drop-down menus and select the ones you need. You can create as many custom rates as you need.

<Image src={addCustomRatesMyActivity} alt="Adding Custom Rates" />

### Using Additional My Activity Options

* **Exclude Approvals for Edited Translations:** select this option to exclude approvals when the same user has translated the string.

* **Pre-Translated Strings Categorization Adjustment:** select this option to have repetitive translations of pre-translated strings categorized under TM or MT match rates, rather than the default Other suggestion match rates.

### Result Analysis {#result-analysis-my-activity}

When the report is generated, you will see the following amounts:

* User Information: profile picture, full name, and username.
* Costs: total for all contributions, contributions to a specific language, distinguished for translation & post-editing and proofreading, and the amount of savings for translations made with TM and MT suggestions.

To download the My Activity report, click **Export report** and select the preferred export format (CSV, XLSX, or JSON).

If you want to regenerate the report with other rates, click **Edit Rates** in the upper-right corner and follow the procedure again.
