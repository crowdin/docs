## Organization Overview

Use this section to get a comprehensive summary of your organization's health, monitor key activities, and track progress over selected time periods. In the upper-right corner, you can select a report unit (*words*, *strings*, *characters*, or *characters with spaces*) that will apply to all reports in this section. The comparisons shown in percentage are counted by comparing the chosen period of time to the same previous period of time (e.g., if you select a month, the current month is compared to the previous one).

To download reports for further analysis or record-keeping, click **Export** and select the preferred format (CSV, XLSX, or JSON).

In the reports that feature interactive graphs, you can hover over data points for more detailed information, such as daily or monthly totals for each category.

The **Organization size** section displays the primary statistics for your organization's volume:

* *Translatable*: The total amount of text available for translation.
* *Hidden*: The total amount of text in hidden strings.
* *Total*: The total amount of text in the organization (*Translatable* + *Hidden*).

Below the main statistics, the **Overview** section contains the following reports:

### Activity Summary

This report tracks the overall translation and proofreading activity in the organization. You can filter the data by **Date Range** and **Language**. The report is split into two main parts: **Translation** and **Proofreading**.

Each part displays the total work completed during the selected period with a percentage comparison to the previous period. You can expand the **Breakdown by Language** section in each part to view a table of the same metrics broken down by target language.

<Aside>
  The Activity Summary shows information about all the translations made in the organization (including duplicate translations made by the same translator, removed translations, etc.).
</Aside>

#### Translation

This section shows the volume of translated text, broken down by the following key metrics:

* *Total (end of period)*
* *Human Translation*
* *Translation Memory*
* *Machine Translation*
* *AI*

The **Translation** graph below the metrics displays multiple lines simultaneously for each translation type. By hovering over the data points, you can view daily or monthly totals for each category.

#### Proofreading

This section shows the volume of approved text and voting activity. The main metric displayed is *Approved* words.

The **Proofreading** graph visualizes the approval and voting activity over time, showing two distinct lines: *Approved Words* and *Votes*. By hovering over the data points, you can view the daily or monthly totals for both approved texts and votes cast.

### Source Content Updates

This report tracks changes made to the source content over a selected time frame. You can filter the data by **Date Range**. The report displays the *Total (end of period)* volume of text, along with specific metrics for content that has been **Added**, **Deleted**, or **Modified**.

<Aside>
  Report data may be displayed with a delay of up to 24 hours.
</Aside>

The bar graph helps you visualize when the most significant content updates occurred. By hovering over the bars, you can see the specific changes that occurred each day or month.

### QA Check Issues

This report provides insights into the automated Quality Assurance (QA) checks, highlighting potential inconsistencies in translations. You can filter the data by **Date Range** and **Language**.

<Aside>
  Report data may be displayed with a delay of up to 24 hours.
</Aside>

Key metrics include:

* *New (Period)*: The number of new QA issues found within the selected period.
* *Total (end of period)*: The total number of unresolved QA issues at the end of the selected period.
* *Per 1000 words*: The density of QA issues relative to the word count. This metric includes approved content and is only shown if the total word count is greater than 1000.
* *Content with Issues*: The volume of text that contains QA issues, including approved content.
* *Content with Issues Rate*: The percentage of text that has QA issues, including approved content.

Below the metrics, the report also features several additional components:

* **Breakdown by Language**: An expandable section that shows a table of the key metrics broken down by each target language.
* **Issues Trend**: A line graph that monitors the total number of QA issues over time. You can hover over data points to see the total number of issues for a specific day.
* **Issues by languages**: A heatmap-style table that visualizes the distribution of QA issue types (e.g., *Spelling mistakes*, *Consistent terminology*) across all target languages. You can hover over a cell to see the precise number of issues for that specific language and type.

## Translation Cost

Use this report to calculate the actual translation and proofreading costs based on the volume of units completed by contributors (e.g., words).

You can generate a Translation Cost report based on the following filter parameters:

* Group by: Member, language, or project.
* Time period: All time, Today, Yesterday, Last 7 days, Last 30 days, Last month, or Custom range.
* Projects: All projects or specific projects.
* Language: All or specific target language.
* Users: All users or specific users.

### Generating a Report {#generating-translation-cost}

To generate the Translation Cost report, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Select the preferred currency and the report unit (word, string, character, or characters (including spaces)).
  1. Use the available filter parameters to specify the report data you're interested in.
  1. Set your [rates](#rates-translation-cost) for translations and approvals.
  1. Click **Generate**.
</Steps>

<Image src={translationCostGenerating} alt="Generating Translation Cost" />

<Aside>
  Rates are automatically saved after you click **Generate**.
</Aside>

### Rates {#rates-translation-cost}

You can set the prices for Base rates (full translation, proofread) and configure Net Rate Schemes (percentage of the full translation rate paid for translation using TM suggestions, MT suggestions, and existing translations).

#### Base Rates {#base-rates-translation-cost}

In the Base Rates section, you can set rates for the following types of work:

* **Full translation** &ndash; for each translation made by a person.
  <Aside>If the string has several translations made by the same person, only one will be counted. If the string has several translations made by different people, each of them will be counted.</Aside>
* **Proofread** &ndash; for each approved translation.

#### Net Rate Schemes {#net-rate-schemes-translation-cost}

In the Net Rate Schemes section, in addition to the base rates, you can set the percentage of the full translation rate to be paid for translations made using TM suggestions, MT suggestions, and other translations of various Match types.

By default, you can configure the percentage of the full translation rate for the following match type categories:

**TM Match types:**

- **101 (perfect)** &ndash; for translations made using Perfect match TM suggestions (source strings are identical to TM suggestion by text and context).
- **100** &ndash; for translations made using 100% match TM suggestions (source strings are identical to TM suggestion only by text).

**MT Match types:**

- **100** &ndash; for translations made using 100% match MT suggestions (new suggested translations are identical to MT suggestion).

**AI Match types:**

- **100** &ndash; for translations made using 100% match AI suggestions (new suggested translations are identical to AI suggestion).

**Other translations types:**

- **100** &ndash; for translations made using existing translations (new suggested translations are identical to the existing translations).

If a string has a combination of TM and MT suggestions and existing translations, the new translation is counted at the lowest Net Rate Scheme value. For example, if a string has a 101% (perfect) TM match suggestion (10% of the full translation rate) and a 100% MT match suggestion (5% of the full translation rate), the new translation added to this string will be counted at a 5% of the full translation rate.

You can also add your own TM, MT, and Other translations match types, specifying the preferred percentage of text similarity and the percentage of the full translation rate to be paid for such a translation.

To add your own match types, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Click <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon" /> in the Net Rate Schemes section.
  1. Click on the appeared <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" /> button.
  1. Specify the match range and the percentage of the full translation rate.
  1. Click <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon" /> to save the settings.
</Steps>

<Image src={addMtMatchType} alt="Adding MT/Other Translation Match Type" />

#### Adding Custom Rates {#custom-rates-translation-cost}

In addition to base rates that are applied to all languages and users by default, you can add custom rates for specific languages and users. To add custom rates, click **Add custom rates**.

To select the languages and members for custom rates, click the drop-down menus, and select the ones you need. You can create as many custom rates as you need.

<Image src={addCustomRatesTranslationCost} alt="Adding Custom Rates" />

### Using Additional Translation Cost Options

* **Exclude Approvals for Edited Translations:** select this option to exclude approvals when the same user has translated the string. This helps ensure that your cost reporting is more accurate by avoiding the duplication of approval costs.

* **Pre-Translated Strings Categorization Adjustment:** select this option to have repetitive translations of pre-translated strings categorized under TM or MT match rates, rather than the default Other suggestion match rates. This is useful because post-editing translations from MT engines usually requires more effort than post-editing translations from human translators, leading to a more precise and fair measure of costs related to your translators.

### Result Analysis {#result-analysis-translation-cost}

When the report is generated, you will see the following amounts:

* **Total** &ndash; organization-level cost for all proofreading and translation activities (including all members and languages). It will be shown at the middle-top of the page.
* **Totals** &ndash; general translation cost for every language or each member. Results are grouped by the parameter you choose.
* **Subtotals** &ndash; separate translation cost for every language or each member. Results are grouped by the parameter you choose.

To download the Translation Cost report, click **Export report** and select the preferred export format (CSV, XLSX, or JSON).

## Task Usage

Use this report to get a detailed overview of task management within your organization. It allows you to analyze workload distribution, compare creation and resolution rates, track team performance and efficiency, monitor task completion times, and review associated costs.

The **Task Usage** report has the following global filters that are applied to all sub-reports by default:

* **Group by**: *Language*, *Type*, or *Project*.

To select the languages and users for custom rates, click the drop-down menus, and select the ones you need. You can create as many custom rates as you need.

#### Rate Templates {#rate-templates-time-spent}

If you plan to work with multiple rate configurations, save them as templates by clicking **Save as > New rates template**, then specify the template name and click **Save**.

Click **Templates** to view and manage your saved rate templates.

<Aside>
  Templates saved for the **Time Spent** report can't be applied to other reports, and consequently, rate templates saved for other reports can't be applied here.
</Aside>

### Result Analysis {#result-analysis-time-spent}

When the report is generated, you will see the following amounts:

* **Total** – The organization-level cost and time spent for all translation and proofreading activities across all projects. It will be shown at the middle-top of the page.
* **Totals** – The total cost and time spent for every language, member, or project. Results are grouped by the parameter you choose.

To download the **Time Spent** report, click **Export report** and select the preferred format (CSV, XLSX, or JSON) for further analysis or record-keeping.

<Aside>
  The generated **Time Spent** report is available for viewing in the [Archive](#archive) section. The time logged for a task is included in the report even if the associated task is later deleted.
</Aside>

## Top Members

The Top Members report allows you to see who contributed the most to your organization's translation.

Default parameters:
- *Text unit*: words
- *Time period*: Last 30 days
- *Sorted by*: translated text units. A member who translated the most is placed at the top of the list.
- *Languages*: all languages
- *Projects*: all projects

The **You** label appears next to your own username in the report table, making it easier to identify your personal contribution.

Re-sort the members by clicking on the needed parameter. For example, if you want to analyze members by their proofreading activity, click on the *Approved* parameter to redo sorting.

<Image src={topMembersSorted} alt="Top Members" />
