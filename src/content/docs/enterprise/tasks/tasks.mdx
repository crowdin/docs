Create and assign tasks for translating or proofreading content to specific project members or vendors. You can set due dates, split words among assignees, receive notifications about task changes and updates, and discuss tasks with other project members in the comments.

## Creating New Task

To create a new task, follow these steps:

<Tabs syncKey="projectType">
  <TabItem label="File-based project">
    <Steps>
      1. Open your project and select **Tasks** on the left sidebar.
      1. Click <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" />**New task**. <Image src={addNew} alt="New Task" />
      1. Set the task parameters:
          * *Type* &ndash; select between *Translate by own translators*, *Proofread by own proofreaders*, *Translate by vendor*, and *Proofread by vendor*.
          * *Workflow step* &ndash; select the necessary step from the project workflow.
          * *[Create a pending proofreading task](#sequential-tasks)* (only for translation tasks) &ndash; creates a separate proofreading task that starts once the translation is completed.
            * Type &ndash; select *Proofread by own proofreaders* or *Proofread by vendor*.
            * *Workflow step* &ndash; select the workflow step for a pending proofreading task.
          * *[Preceding task](#sequential-tasks)* (only for proofreading tasks) &ndash; link the task to a previously created translation task to inherit its scope and language settings.
          * *Skip strings already included in other tasks* &ndash; skip strings that are already assigned to other tasks.
          * *Rates template* (optional) – select the [template](/enterprise/project-reports/#rate-templates) to be used for calculating task costs. You can set a template independently to clarify cost calculations without immediately generating reports.
          * *[Create Cost Estimate Report](#generating-and-viewing-reports)* – automatically generate a Cost Estimate report after the task is created or edited.
          * *[Create Translation Cost Report](#generating-and-viewing-reports)* – automatically generate a Translation Cost report when the task status is changed to **Done** or **Closed**.
          * *String filters* &ndash; filter which strings should be included in the task:
            * *Strings* &ndash; select whether to include *All ToDo strings on the selected step*, only those modified within a specific period, or only those with translations updated within a specific period (only for proofreading tasks).
            * *Filter by labels* (optional) &ndash; select one or more labels to include only strings with the specified labels. Then, select the match rule:
              * *All selected labels* &ndash; includes only strings that have all selected labels (AND logic).
              * *Any selected label* &ndash; includes strings that have at least one of the selected labels (OR logic).
            * *Exclude by labels* (optional) &ndash; select one or more labels to exclude strings with the specified labels. Then, select the match rule:
              * *All selected labels* &ndash; excludes only strings that have all selected labels (AND logic).
              * *Any selected label* &ndash; excludes strings that have at least one of the selected labels (OR logic).
            * *Include pre-translated strings only* (only for proofreading tasks) &ndash; include only strings that were previously pre-translated.
          * *Due Date* (optional) &ndash; set a deadline.
          * *Files* &ndash; select files to include in the task.
          * *Languages* &ndash; select target languages (a separate task will be created for each selected language). The *Words to do* column shows the total number of words added to the task.
            * Click **Assign** to assign users to the task for each language separately.
            * *(Optional)* Use a saved [template](#task-templates) to apply language and member assignment settings, or save the current configuration for future use.
          * *Title* &ndash; specify the name of the task that will be visible to translators or proofreaders.
          * *Description* (optional) &ndash; add any additional details that may be helpful.

<Aside type="tip" title="Good to know">
  - The Workflow step parameter is only applicable when creating a task for [projects with a workflow](/enterprise/creating-project/#projects-with-a-workflow).
  - For the Proofread type tasks, all the strings, excluding the approved ones, will be added to the task.
  - One task can be assigned to one project only.

### Splitting Content

Splitting content between several members allows you to speed up the translation or proofreading process.

While in string-based and file-based projects this option is called differently (i.e., **Split strings** and **Split files**), the basic principle of its behavior remains the same.

To split content between several members select **Split files** (in file-based project) or **Split strings** (in file-based project) in the **Assign users** dialog. You can set the approximate amount of words for each assignee.

<Image src={split} alt="Splitting Files" class="width-xl" />

### Estimating and Tracking Task Costs

If a [**Rates template**](/enterprise/project-reports/#rate-templates) is selected during task creation, the **Finance** section will appear when viewing the created task. This section provides an overview of the selected rate scheme and any generated financial reports.

<Aside title="Permissions">
  Project members with manager permissions (or higher) can view the generated reports and exact financial figures in the **Finance** section. For all other project roles, this section only displays the name of the selected **Rates template**.
</Aside>

#### Task Finance Overview

After a report is generated, it becomes available in the [Archive](/enterprise/project-reports/#archive) section. The costs are also displayed directly on the task card in the **Board** section. Hover over <Icon name="material-symbols:payments" class="inline-icon" /> on a task card to view both the **Estimated cost** and **Actual cost**.

Open the task to view the **Finance** section, which includes the following details:

* **Rate Template**: Displays the name of the applied template. Project managers can click the template name to open the **Edit rates template** dialog and view or modify its parameters (e.g., Base rates, Custom rates, Net Rate Schemes).
* **Estimated cost**: If the **Create Cost Estimate Report** option was selected, this report is generated automatically after the task is created or updated. If the task scope changes (e.g., files or strings are modified), a new Cost Estimate report will be generated automatically to reflect the updated estimate.
* **Actual cost**: If the **Create Translation Cost Report** option was selected, this report is generated automatically once the task is moved to the **Done** or **Closed** status.

Both the estimated and actual cost sections will display the calculated cost based on the selected rates template, a clickable report name (e.g., Report #123) that links to the full report in the Archive section, and the report generation date.

#### Generating and Viewing Reports

You can manually generate or regenerate reports for an existing task at any time. Click <Icon name="mdi:dots-horizontal" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-right corner of the task view and select **Cost estimate** or **Translation cost**.

To view a detailed breakdown, click the report name (e.g., Report #123) under the Estimated or Actual cost. The full report will open in a new browser tab. Within the opened report, click **Rate Schema** to review the specific rates applied during its generation.

#### Resolving Rates Mismatch

If the underlying rates or the assigned rate template are modified after a report has been generated, a **Rates Mismatch** label will appear next to the Estimated or Actual cost. This label indicates that the current template configuration differs from the one used to generate the report, meaning the displayed costs might be outdated.

To resolve the mismatch and update the costs, click the report name in the **Finance** section and regenerate the report. The system will apply the latest rates, and the **Rates Mismatch** label will disappear.

### Task Templates

Use task templates to save the configuration of the **Languages** section, including target languages and member assignments. Templates help you quickly apply these configurations when creating new tasks, saving time and ensuring consistency.

<Aside>
  [Splitting content](#splitting-content) between members is configured separately and is **not** saved within templates.
</Aside>

#### Saving Templates

To save the language and member assignment settings as a template, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. In the **Languages** section, click **Save as**.
  1. Select **New template** from the drop-down menu.
  1. In the dialog that appears, enter a name for your template.
  1. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

Your template is now saved and available for future tasks.

<Image src={newTemplate} alt="Saving a Task Template" />

#### Applying Templates

To apply a saved template to a new task, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. In the **Languages** section, click on the template name to apply it immediately.
  1. Alternatively, click <Icon name="mdi:dots-vertical" class="inline-icon" /> next to the template name and select **Apply**.
</Steps>

#### Managing Templates

To rename or delete a saved template, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. In the **Languages** section, click <Icon name="mdi:dots-vertical" class="inline-icon" /> next to the template name.
  1. Select one of the following options:
     * **Rename** – Enter a new name for your template.
     * **Delete** – Permanently remove the template.
</Steps>

<Image src={managingTemplates} alt="Managing Task Templates" />

## Project Tasks

In the **Tasks** section, you can view all the project tasks in the following two sections: **Board**, **All Tasks**.

### Board

In the **Board** section, tasks are organized into three columns: To Do, In Progress, and Done. This layout provides a clear view and visualization of the current status of all tasks. Within each column, tasks are further grouped by target languages. Each target language group can be collapsed to hide task cards or expanded to display them. This feature is particularly useful for decluttering the view and focusing on specific languages.

Use the **Search** field to search for tasks by name or [filter tasks](#filtering-tasks) using various filter options. To view the task details, open it by clicking on the task name.

<Image src={board} alt="Board" />

### All Tasks

The **All Tasks** section provides a list view of all project tasks. It is particularly useful for efficiently managing large volumes of tasks. From this view, you can select multiple tasks to perform bulk actions, such as changing assignees, updating statuses, or deleting tasks.

Similar to the **Board** section, the **All Tasks** view also allows you to use the **Search** field and [filter](#filtering-tasks). Additionally, you can sort the task list in ascending or descending order using the available sort options (ID, Created at, Resolved at, Due Date).

#### Generating Reports for Multiple Tasks

From the **All Tasks** view, you can generate a **Cost Estimate** or **Translation Cost** report for one or more specific tasks. This allows you to quickly assess costs without having to manually select tasks on the report generation page.

To generate a report for selected tasks, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. In the **All Tasks** view, select the desired tasks using the checkboxes. You can use filters to narrow down the list before selection.
  2. Click <Icon name="mdi:dots-vertical" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-right corner.
  3. Select **Cost estimate** or **Translation cost** from the drop-down menu.
</Steps>

You will then be redirected to the corresponding report generation page with the selected tasks pre-filled, where you can configure and generate the report.

### Editing Task

To change the task details, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and select **Tasks** on the left sidebar.
  1. In the **Board** or **All tasks** section, click <Icon name="mdi:dots-vertical" class="inline-icon" /> (or right-click) on the task you want to change and select **Edit**. <Image src={edit} alt="Editing Task" />
  1. Make the necessary edits and click **Save**.
</Steps>

<QuestionAnswer title="How do the source file updates affect the existing translation and proofreading tasks?">
  After the source file update, the list of source strings included in the task will be updated in the following way:

  * The strings removed from the source file during the update will be removed from the task.
  * The modified strings marked with the *Keep Translations* option will appear in the task with the new modified text.
  * The newly added strings won't affect the existing task in any way.

  If the source file is restored to the revision containing the removed strings, they will reappear in the task.
</QuestionAnswer>

### Viewing Tasks Created Together

When you create tasks for multiple languages at once, they are generated as a single batch. To easily find and navigate between all tasks from the same batch, you can use the **Tasks Created Together** option.

To view tasks created together, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open any task from the batch.
  2. Click <Icon name="mdi:dots-vertical" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-right corner.
  3. Select **Tasks Created Together**.
</Steps>

You will be redirected to the **All Tasks** section with a `batchId` filter (e.g., `batchId:123456`) automatically applied in the search field. This view will display only the tasks that were generated during that specific creation process.

### Filtering Tasks

By default, all project tasks are displayed in the **Tasks** section either in the **Board** or **All Tasks** sections. If necessary, you can filter tasks using the available filter options:

* Target language: All languages or particular language.
* Assignee: All users or particular user.
* Created by: All users or particular user.
* Due date: All, Overdue now, Custom range.
* Created: All, Custom range.
* Type: All types, Translate by own translators, Proofread by own proofreaders, Translate by vendor, Proofread by vendor.
* Workflow step: All, No workflow step, or particular workflow step.
* File: All files or particular file or folder.
* Status: All statuses, To Do, In Progress, Done, Closed.

<Image src={filter} alt="Filtering Tasks" />

### Changing Task Status

To change the task status in the **Board** section, select the task assigned to you and drag it to the column with the status you need.

<Aside>
  Only admins can change the task status for all the project tasks.
</Aside>

<Image src={move} alt="Changing Task Status" />

To change the task status in the **All Tasks** section, select the needed task, click **Change status**, and select the new status.

Alternatively, in either of the two sections, you can change the task status directly in the task itself using the **Status** drop-down menu and selecting needed statuses.

### Closing Task

To close the task when it's finished, move it to the **Done** column and click **Close Task**.

<Image src={close} alt="Closing Task" class="width-sm" />

To view the list of closed tasks, open the **All Tasks** section and use the filter **Status: Closed**.

## Sequential Tasks

Sequential tasks streamline the management of translation and proofreading processes in a structured, step-by-step manner. This feature is particularly useful for managing content that requires translation followed by proofreading, ensuring a smooth workflow.

Once created, sequential tasks are represented on the Tasks Board, displaying both the translation task and its linked pending proofreading task.

<Image src={pendingSequentialTasks} alt="Pending Proofreading Sequential Task" />

### Key Approaches

The concept of sequential tasks is based on two primary approaches:

* **Creating a translation task with its associated pending proofreading task:**
  * Start by creating a translation task and specifying the target languages and work scope.
  * Select **Create a pending proofreading task** to generate the associated proofreading task. You can set separate due dates for the translation and proofreading tasks if needed.
  <Image src={createPendingProofreadingTask} alt="Create a pending proofreading task" />
  * While translators work on the translation task, the linked proofreading task remains pending.
  * When the translation task is completed, the status of the associated proofreading task changes from Pending to To Do. Proofreaders will then receive notifications that it's ready for review.
* **Creating a proofreading task and linking it to a translation task:**
  * Create a proofreading task and select the translation task you want to link it with from the **Preceding task** drop-down menu. You can link it to either a completed or an active translation task.
  <Image src={selectPrecedingTranslationTask} alt="Select preceding translation task" />
  * The languages and work scope are automatically inherited from the linked translation task.
  * The proofreading task remains pending until the linked translation task is completed.
  * As with the first approach, proofreaders receive notifications when the proofreading task is ready for review.

### Task Types Supported

Sequential tasks are available for the following task types:

* Translate by own translators
* Proofread by own translators
* Translate by vendor
* Proofread by vendor

### Sequential Task Management

* When editing a pending proofreading task, changes are limited to fields that do not affect the scope of the task.
* Pending proofreading tasks can be deleted if necessary. In this case, linked translation tasks are preserved.
* Deleting a translation task with an associated sequential proofreading task results in the deletion of both tasks simultaneously.

## Task Cross-Review :badge[New]{variant=success} {#task-cross-review}

The **Task Cross-Review** feature helps ensure proper oversight in task workflows by requiring approval before contributors can start working. It’s especially beneficial for teams with internal approval processes, such as budget approvals, where tasks must be reviewed and approved by designated managers or the owner. By adding an extra layer of accountability, this feature ensures tasks don’t move forward without proper review.

<Image src={pendingCrossReviewTasks} alt="Pending Cross-Review Task" />

### How Task Cross-Review Works

When **Task Cross-Review** is enabled:

* During task creation, a notification informs the user that the task will require approval from eligible project members (selected managers or the owner) before assigned members can start working.

* On the Board, tasks awaiting approval display an alert indicating they are pending review from selected managers or the owner, making them easy to identify.

* In the task details view, an alert states, *"The task is currently pending review from selected managers or the owner,"* and the task is labeled with the status **For Approval**.

Only selected managers or the owner can approve the task. The manager who created the task cannot approve it, but the owner can always approve their own tasks. Once approved, the task status changes to **<span style={{ whiteSpace: 'nowrap' }}>To Do</span>**, indicating that contributors can begin work.
