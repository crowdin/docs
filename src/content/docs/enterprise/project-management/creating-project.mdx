A project is the main place where you can manage and organize your localization process.

You can create an independent project in the Workspace root or within a specific group. Each project within the group inherits the group's resources, managers, workflow templates, Translation Memories, Glossaries, and Machine Translation engines.

## Project Types

Crowdin Enterprise offers flexibility in the way you structure and manage your localization projects. There are two main project types: *File-based* and *String-based*.

### <Icon name="mdi:file-document" class="inline-icon"/>File-based Project

The file-based project in Crowdin Enterprise revolves around uploading source files containing translatable content. This project type is well-suited for scenarios with well-defined source files, such as Android XML, iOS Strings, JSON, and more. It allows for precise mapping between source and translation files, making it a preferred choice for many localization workflows.

### <Icon name="mdi:format-list-bulleted" class="inline-icon"/>String-based Project

In string-based projects, the focus is on managing translatable content as individual strings rather than source files. In this project type, after uploading source files, Crowdin Enterprise parses them into source strings. Unlike file-based projects, source files aren't stored, and the emphasis is on managing the content at the string level. This approach is beneficial when dealing with projects that involve continuous content updates, dynamic content, or where a string-oriented structure is preferred.

## Projects with or without a Workflow

When creating a project, you have two possible options for how you can organize your localization process within the project:

* [Project without a workflow](#projects-without-a-workflow)
* [Project with a workflow](#projects-with-a-workflow)

Anytime you can switch between these two different approaches to managing a project's localization process by assigning or removing a workflow.

### Projects without a Workflow

A project without a workflow is a streamlined localization project setup where translations are managed without predefined steps or automated processes.

When working with this kind of project configuration, you can assign dedicated translators and proofreaders to the project target languages or use [Tasks](/enterprise/tasks/) to manage the localization process.

This type of project setup allows you to start the localization process right away in cases when the preferred workflow still needs to be agreed upon or if you prefer a simpler approach. While this setup provides more freedom, it also requires more manual coordination and management of translation tasks.

#### Use cases

* Get to know the main features of Crowdin Enterprise.
* Quickly start translating content without having to spend time setting up a workflow. Especially useful if you still need an agreed workflow.
* Good if there is no need for automation (e.g., automated pre-translation via TM/MT, filtering content via custom code step, ordering translations and proofreading via vendors, etc.).
* Good when the translation strategy is the same for all target languages in the project.

### Projects with a Workflow

A project with a workflow is a structured localization project setup that follows a predefined sequence of steps for managing translations.

Workflows consist of multiple steps (e.g., source text review, pre-translation, translation, proofreading, etc.), which define the order and conditions that content in your project should go through and the responsibilities of project members involved in the localization process. Each step can be assigned to specific project members or vendors, ensuring a systematic and controlled progression of translation tasks.

Using a workflow in your project, you can automate certain actions, such as pre-translation via translation memory or machine translation engines, filtering and splitting content into two workflow threads according to specific predefined conditions, sending content for translation and proofreading to vendors, etc.

This type of project setup suits larger or more complex localization projects where consistent and standardized processes are desired.

#### Use cases

* Order professional translation and proofreading services from vendors.
* Involve your community in the translation process.
* Automate content translation via translation memory or machine translation engines.
* Use individual localization strategies for different target languages (translate some languages with the help of the community and others with vendors, translate languages with different MT engines, etc.).

## Creating a Project

To create a project, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your organization's **Workspace**, hover over the <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" />**Create** button at the lower-right corner, and select **Create a project**. <Image src={createProject} alt="Start to create a project" />
  1. Enter the project name. <Image src={provideProjectName} alt="Provide the project name" class="width-lg" />
  1. Select the source language and target languages. The source language is the language you're translating from, and the target languages are the ones you're translating into. <Image src={chooseLanguages} alt="Choose the languages" class="width-lg" />
  1. Select **String-based** if you want to manage your translatable content as individual strings. Otherwise, keep **File-based** selected to manage your translatable content as source files. <Aside type="caution">The project type cannot be changed once the project is created.</Aside>
  1. Select the existing TM and glossary for your new project to be used as defaults. Alternatively, to create your new project with clean resources, leave the **Create new translation memory** and **Create new glossary** options selected. You can change the [default TM](/enterprise/project-settings/translation-memories/#changing-default-tm) and [default glossary](/enterprise/project-settings/glossaries/#changing-default-glossary) in the project's **Settings**.
  1. *(Optional)* Assign a workflow or [create a new one](/enterprise/workflows/).

      For projects with an assigned workflow, you can enable the **Delay workflow start** during the project creation. This will allow you to upload existing translations and resources (TM, Glossary) before the project becomes available for translation. Once ready to start with the translation, open your project and click **Start workflow** in the **Dashboard**.

      Alternatively, remove the workflow to create a project without a workflow. <Image src={chooseWorkflow} alt="Choose a workflow" class="width-lg" />
  1. Click **Create project**.
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip" title="Tips">
  - You can select target languages manually or via **Pre-fill** by using the top 30 languages. If you'd like to translate your project into target languages not officially supported, you can still add them as [custom languages](/enterprise/project-settings/languages/#adding-custom-languages).
  - If you click **Remember selection** at the bottom right, the selected settings will be used as a template the next time you create a project. You can edit the settings afterward.
  - Use [Fields](/enterprise/fields/) to add custom properties to your project.
