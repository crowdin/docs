Each time you upload XML, HTML, MD, or any other source files without a key-value structure, the predefined segmentation rules (SRX 2.0) are used for automatic content segmentation. Although, there might be situations when the default segmentation rules segment source files in contrast to the desired expectations.

In this case, you can define your own segmentation rules for each source file individually using the [SRX 2.0 standard](https://www.gala-global.org/srx-20-april-7-2008).

## Change Segmentation

You can change segmentation in **Sources > Files**.

<Steps>
  1. Open the project where you’d like to adjust the segmentation rules and go to **Sources > Files**.
  1. Click <Icon name="mdi:dots-vertical" class="inline-icon" /> (or right-click) on the needed file and select **Settings**. <Image src={fileContextMenuSettings} alt="File context menu settings" />
  1. In the appeared dialog, switch to the **Parser configuration** tab.
  1. In the **Excluded elements** field, specify all elements that should not be imported.
  1. Select **Enable content segmentation** and **Use custom segmentation rules**.
  1. Paste your SRX segmentation rules and click **Save**. <Image src={fileParserConfiguration} alt="File parser configuration" width="600" />
</Steps>

After you save your new segmentation rules, your source file will be automatically reimported and segmented according to these new rules.

## Segmentation Examples

<Aside>
  Regular expressions used in SRX rules must be compatible with PHP (PCRE2) and Node.js.
</Aside>

A typical SRX file looks similar to the following:

<Include file="srx-file-example.mdx" />

### Change Sentence Separator for Asian Languages

Usually, the full stop is used as a sentence separator. Although, for some Asian languages, it's not the case. For example, the typical sentence separator in Chinese is an ideographic full stop (`。`). For such cases, you may want to use the following ruleset:

```xml
<rule break="yes">
  <beforebreak>[\x3002]+</beforebreak>
  <afterbreak></afterbreak>
</rule>
```

### Break Text into Smaller Parts

In the following simple sentence, we'll break down a case when segmenting one text piece into two (or more) strings is necessary.

Text with default segmentation rules:

`This is the first part of the sample sentence and this is the second part.`

Text with new segmentation rules:

`This is the first part of the sample sentence`

<code>&#32;and this is the second part.</code>

For this particular case, the following ruleset will break the initial sentence into two parts:

```xml
<rule break="yes">
  <beforebreak>sentence</beforebreak>
  <afterbreak>\u0020</afterbreak>
</rule>
```

## Create Segmentation Rules with SRX Editors

The SRX segmentation rules can be created and maintained with the help of tools like [Ratel](http://okapiframework.org/wiki/index.php?title=Ratel). It has a visual interface where you can generate segmentation rules from scratch or edit your existing ones.
