The XML files, similar to CSV and XLSX files, require additional configuration after uploading to the project so the system could import the content of these files.

To configure XML files, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Sources > Files**.
  2. Click **Configure** next to the file to open the configuration window.
  3. Select which content should be translated and click **Save & Import** to proceed.
</Steps>

## Configuration Options

When configuring XML files, you’ll have the following options: **Basic Configuration** and **Advanced Configuration**. Additionally, you can use the **Content Segmentation**, which is available for both configuration options.

### Basic Configuration

Basic Configuration allows you to select all nodes and/or all attributes to be available for translation.

### Advanced Configuration

Advanced Configuration allows you to select the specific nodes and specific attributes to be available for translation.

The file structure is depicted with the help of icons:

- <Icon name="mdi:label" class="inline-icon"/> – Node
- <Icon name="mdi:tag" class="inline-icon"/> – Attribute

### Configure All XML Files at the Same Time

To configure all XML files at once, click **Configure All** at the top of the **Files** tab.

When using **Configure All**, ensure that all XML files contain the same structural elements. Otherwise, some nodes that require translation might be unavailable during configuration and won't be imported into the project. In this case, it would be necessary to configure each XML file separately.

In the configuration window, you'll be able to switch between the selected files to preview and verify if the applied configuration is correct for all files.

## Content Segmentation

You can use **Content Segmentation** to split the source file's content into shorter text pieces, mostly sentences and short paragraphs. This is helpful when translating content units consisting of several sentences because it will be easier to translate smaller pieces of text. Segmentation Rules eXchange (SRX) are used for automatic content segmentation.

<Aside>
  When Content segmentation is enabled, the translation upload is handled by an experimental machine learning technology.
