Localize project content with all the graphics (pictures, logos, non-textual files) in one place. File formats that are not supported by Crowdin Enterprise (e.g., .png, .psd, .jpeg) will be uploaded as assets.

<Aside type="tip">
  There is an option to add custom formats instead of using assets. Search the [Crowdin Store](https://store.crowdin.com/) or contact our [Support Team](https://crowdin.com/contacts) for more details or available workarounds.

## Use Cases

You may upload assets and make all localization data accessible for translators in Crowdin Enterprise. This helps to:

- Keep all translation data stored under the same roof
- Avoid miscommunication, as you may provide detailed translation instructions for project members by adding context
- Ease the integration of translated content back online, as the initial file formats will be preserved

## Typical Workflow

To work with assets, follow these steps:.

<Steps>
  1. Upload files to your Crowdin Enterprise project.
  1. Add necessary [references](#typical-asset-references) for the translators to understand how the translations should be done. Use *Context* for additional details.
  1. Allow translators to download the files. For this, open your project and go to **Settings > Privacy > Translations** and enable **Allow offline translation**. <ReadMore>Read more about [offline translation](/enterprise/offline-translation).</ReadMore>
  1. Translators will download the files, localize them offline, and upload the translated versions back
</Steps>

## Typical Asset References

- Adobe Photoshop PSD file (an editable source file that translators can modify according to the localization requirements).
- Font files since some assets may use custom fonts.
- Style guide (is shown in the editor as a context or additional downloadable file).
- Manual/instruction that guides through the localization process step by step.

## Assets in TXT Format

Some unsupported text formats (e.g., .toc, .gitignore) will be imported to Crowdin Enterprise as .txt files. Users can translate such files in Crowdin Enterprise directly.
