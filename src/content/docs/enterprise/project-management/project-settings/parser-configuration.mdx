By default, Crowdin Enterprise uses a predefined set of import and export parameters for each supported file format.

The Parser configuration feature lets you change the default import and export behavior predefined for file formats supported by Crowdin Enterprise. Parser configuration in a specific project is applied only to files stored in this project.

You can set the parser configuration for all files of a certain format or single files. Once you save the parser configuration for some file format, you can upload source files to your project, and Crowdin Enterprise will apply your settings accordingly.

You can configure import and export behavior for the following formats: Java Properties, Generic XML, DITA, AsciiDoc, Plain text, MadCap Flare, HTML, Office documents, Adobe FrameMaker, Adobe InDesign, Markdown, and MediaWiki.

## Parser Configuration Parameters

Some parameters are common to all formats, while others are format-specific. In the table below, you can see the available parser parameters and formats they could be configured for.

## Parser Configuration for All Project Files of a Specific Format

To set the preferred parser configuration for all files of a specific format, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Settings > Parser configuration**.
  1. Choose the needed file format and click Edit.
  1. Set the preferred settings.
  1. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

To add a new file format, click **Add Apps** and install the required format.

## Parser Configuration for a Single File

In some cases, you might need to set the parser configuration not for all files of some file format but just for a single file. To set the parser configuration for a single file, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Sources > Files**.
  1. Double-click on the needed file.
  1. In the appeared dialog, switch to the **Parser configuration** tab.
  1. Set the preferred settings.
  1. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

Once you save the file parser configuration, Crowdin Enterprise will reimport this file and apply your settings.
