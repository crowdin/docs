The main aim of quality assurance (QA) checks is to help you efficiently handle different language-specific aspects in translations and ensure they are formatted the same way as the source strings and will fit the UI just as well. Some typical QA check issues include missed commas, extra spaces, or typos.

With QA checks, issues that should be fixed will be highlighted on the Proofread workflow step. QA checks help to detect some common mistakes easily and quickly. It's recommended to review and resolve all QA check issues before building your project and downloading translations.

In the **Quality Assurance** section, you can manage the types of QA issues to be highlighted in the Editor during the translation process.

## Configure QA Checks

By default, QA checks are enabled. To select the needed QA checks in your project, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Settings > Quality assurance**.
  1. Select the QA check types according to your preferences.
  1. For each selected QA check type, select whether it should be possible to save translations with QA issues using two available options: **Error** and **Warning**.
</Steps>

**Warning** &ndash; the system notifies translators about the QA issues with suggestions on how to fix them, but it would still be possible to save the translation using the **Save anyway** button.

**Error** &ndash; the system notifies translators about the QA issues with suggestions on how to fix them. It wouldn't be possible to save the translation until all QA issues are fixed.

Once enabled, QA checks will work in the background and scan the translations for potential QA issues.

## Spell Checker Ignore List

If your project contains some uncommon words that are not recognized by the Spell checker, you can add them to the Ignore list to exclude them from being checked.

To review the words added to the Ignore list for the Spell checker, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Settings > Quality assurance**.
  1. Click *Ignore list* on the top right side.
</Steps>

In the opened window you can see the list of words added to the ignore list. You can filter or remove them from the list if necessary.

## QA Check Parameters

**Omissions** &ndash; strings that lack or have excessive translations.

- Source is empty but the translation is not
- Translation is empty but the source is not

**Translation length limit** &ndash; translations that are longer than the limit of characters you set.

<Aside type="tip">
  To set character limits for specific strings, go to **Sources > Strings**. Double-click on the needed string and set the max. length. This means that translators will be notified that a translation for the particular string can't be longer than the specified limit. This is useful when the space for the given text is limited.
