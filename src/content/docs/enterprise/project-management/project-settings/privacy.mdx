In the **Privacy** section of the Project Settings, you can manage the visibility of your project and its contents. You can also configure the notifications sent to project participants.

## Translations

* **Allow Offline Translation** &ndash; allow translators to download source files to their machines for offline translation and upload translations back into the project. The project owner and managers can always download sources and upload translations, not depending on the option status.
* **Allow proofreaders to access hidden strings** &ndash; allow proofreaders to work with hidden strings. Members with manager permissions or higher can always work with hidden strings, not depending on the option status.
* **Task-based access control** &ndash; allow project members to work with tasks they are assigned to, even if they do not have full access to the language in the project.
  <Aside>
    Users with any role (like translators, proofreaders) in your project will still have access to the content!
    To restrict access to content assigned to users via tasks:
    - Invite users to the project without a role.
    - Create a task and assign it to a user.
  </Aside>

## Glossary Access Settings

Control the level of access that project members have over glossary terms. Members with manager permissions or higher always have full control over glossary terms, regardless of these settings.

Configure the preferred glossary access level with the following options:

* **Read only** &ndash; allow members to view existing glossary terms without the possibility to modify them. This option provides access for reference only.
* **Manage drafts** &ndash; allow members to view, add, edit, and delete draft glossary terms, and view approved terms. This option allows members to contribute to drafts without altering approved terms.
* **Full access** &ndash; allow members to view, add, edit, and delete glossary terms, as well as edit concept details. This option provides members with full control over glossary terms and their details.

## Notifications

Project notifications are disabled by default. Enable the necessary notifications for an agile translation process. Such approach helps to avoid creating additional tasks for every contributor.

* **Notify translators about new strings** &ndash; translators will receive an email notification about newly added content for translation each time after the update.
The **Receive emails** option should be activated in the translator’s profile.
* **Notify project managers and developers about new strings** &ndash; project managers will receive an email notification about newly added content for translation each time after the update.
* **Notify project managers and developers about language translation/proofreading completion** &ndash; project managers will receive the notification when some target language (all source files) is fully translated or fully proofread.
