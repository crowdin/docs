In the **Privacy** section of the Project Settings, you can manage the visibility of your project and its contents. You can also configure the notifications sent to project participants.

## Translations

* **Show machine translation suggestions** &ndash; enable MT suggestions from machine translation engines such as Microsoft Translator, Google Translate, and others to be displayed in the Editor. The organization admin should [configure machine translation engines](/enterprise/machine-translation) before using them.
* **Allow Offline Translation** &ndash; allow translators to download source files to their machines for offline translation and upload translations back into the project. The project owner and managers can always download sources and upload translations, not depending on the option status.
* **Allow project members to manage glossary terms** &ndash; allow translators and proofreaders to add new glossary terms to the project. The project owner and managers can always add and edit glossary terms, not depending on the option status.
* **Task-based access control** &ndash; allow project members to work with tasks they are assigned to, even if they do not have full access to the language in the project.
  <Aside>
    Users with any role (like translators, proofreaders) in your project will still have access to the content!
    To restrict access to content assigned to users via tasks:
    - Invite users to the project without a role.
    - Create a task and assign it to a user.
  </Aside>

## Notifications

Project notifications are disabled by default. Enable the necessary notifications for an agile translation process. Such approach helps to avoid creating additional tasks for every contributor.

* **Notify translators about new strings** &ndash; translators will receive an email notification about newly added content for translation each time after the update.
The **Receive emails** option should be activated in the translatorâ€™s profile.
* **Notify project managers and developers about new strings** &ndash; project managers will receive an email notification about newly added content for translation each time after the update.
* **Notify project managers and developers about language translation/proofreading completion** &ndash; project managers will receive the notification when some target language (all source files) is fully translated or fully proofread.
