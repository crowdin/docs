By default, when exporting translations, Crowdin Enterprise fills untranslated strings with source text to avoid exporting empty files. You can change this behavior in the **Export** section of the Project Settings.

### Export strings with at least 1 translation

Choose if you want to export all translated strings without approval.

### Export translations with a specific number of approvals

Choose if you want to export only strings with approved translations. Make sure the number of required approvals set isn't higher than the actual number of proofreading steps in your project workflow.

<Aside>
  Number of required approvals cannot be higher than number of proofreading steps present in the project workflow.
</Aside>

### Export strings that passed workflow

Strings that reached the End step will be included in the exported files.

### Automatically fill in regional dialects

Useful when the project is translated into the language dialects (e.g., Spanish, Argentina). On export, translations from Spanish will be automatically copied to untranslated strings in Spanish, Argentina.

### Skip untranslated strings

Only translated strings will be included in the exported translation files.

This option works in three different ways, depending on the file format. This option is not applied to text-formatted documents since missing texts can make downloaded files unreadable. Others are exported with empty values. And for the third file category, untranslated strings are entirely removed from the exported translation files.

<Include file="skip-untranslated-strings-formats.mdx" />

### Skip untranslated files

Only 100% translated files will be included in the exported translation archive.

<Aside>
  if this option is enabled, it overrides the effect of the *Skip untranslated strings* option.
</Aside>

### Save context information in the files

The context and max.length added in Crowdin Enterprise will be visible in the downloaded files. This option only applies to CSV, Android XML, iOS strings, and RESX formats.

<Aside type="caution" title="Limitations">
  This option only partially applies to iOS strings and RESX formats (i.e., only the context added in Crowdin Enterprise will be visible in the downloaded files).
