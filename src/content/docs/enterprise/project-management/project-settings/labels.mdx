Use labels in your project to easily organize resources (e.g., screenshots, strings, etc.) by specific topics. Once you add labels, you can filter items by those labels. If you already use labels for your source strings, you can use the same labels for screenshots.

## Managing Project Labels

To create, edit, or remove project labels, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project **Settings** and navigate to the **Labels** section.
  1. In the appeared screen, add new labels and edit or remove existing ones.
</Steps>

<Image src={projectLabels} alt="Manage project labels" />

To edit or remove a label, click <Icon name="mdi:dots-vertical" class="inline-icon" /> (or right-click) on the label you want to edit or remove and select the appropriate action. Use the **Search** field above the label list to quickly find specific labels.

<Aside type="caution">
  Labels are case insensitive (e.g., `Label` and `label` are treated as identical).
</Aside>
