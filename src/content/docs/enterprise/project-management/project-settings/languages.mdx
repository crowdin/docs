In the **Languages** section, you can manage your project source and target languages and configure language mapping to use custom language codes.

## Source Language

The source language is the language you're translating from. If you want to change the source language for your project, select a new language from the drop-down list and click **Save**.

Here are a few points you should be aware of when changing the projectâ€™s source language:

* Please note that there might be a plural form mismatch for imported strings depending on the new source language. For example, some plural forms might not be displayed in the Editor, or some plural form translations might be used in other ones on translation export. We recommend updating the source files if the new source language has different plural forms than the initial one.
* If you had an opened browser tab with the Editor during the source language update, you might need to refresh it for changes to take effect and continue translating from the new source language.

## Target Languages

The **Target Languages** section allows you to add or remove target languages in your project.

You can update your target languages anytime. To add or remove target languages in your project, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Settings > Languages**.
  2. In the **Target Languages** section, you can make the following changes:
      * Select the languages you want to add to the project in the left panel.
      * Click <Icon name="mdi:close-circle" class="inline-icon" /> on the languages you want to remove from the project in the right panel.
  3. Click **Update**.
</Steps>

## Language Mapping

Add custom language codes and use them for translation files export. This will keep the structure of exported files consistent.

For example, in the screenshot below two custom codes are set for French and German languages. If any of custom placeholders (3 letters codes) is used during [file export](/enterprise/file-management#file-export) the file name will include these specific language codes (fra, ger).

## Adding Custom Languages

Custom languages are managed at the Organization level. See the [Organization Settings](/enterprise/organization-settings/) section for more information.
