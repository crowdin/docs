In the project's **Settings > AI** section, you can configure and manage AI prompts and select prompts to be used in the Editor for features like AI Assistant, AI Suggestions, AI Alignment, and AI-powered QA Check.

By default, the prompts to be used in the Editor are applied from the organization's AI settings. If default AI settings in the project owner's account are not configured to apply automatically to all projects, it's necessary to select the appropriate AI prompts in the project's settings to activate the AI Assistant, AI Suggestions, AI Alignment, and AI-powered QA Check features. Otherwise, these features will remain inactive.

The AI prompts configured in the project settings will also be added to the list of AI prompts of the organization.

AI Prompt Types:

- Pre-Translate
- AI in Editor
- AI Alignment
- QA Check
- Custom type

Before the AI Prompts can be configured in the project settings, it's also necessary for the organization owner or admins to [configure the AI Providers](/enterprise/crowdin-ai/#configuring-ai-providers).
