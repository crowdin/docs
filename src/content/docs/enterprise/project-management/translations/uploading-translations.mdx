If you have some existing translations, you can upload them to your project in Crowdin Enterprise.

For file-based projects, this can be done through the **Translations** section or directly from a specific file in the Editor. For string-based projects, use the **Upload** section or access the target language in the Editor to upload XLIFF translations.

<Aside>
  The maximum file size is 100 MB. If your file exceeds this limit, it is recommended to split it into several smaller files, and upload them one at a time.
</Aside>

The best practice is to upload translated files with the key-value structure.

## Uploading Translations via Project page

To upload translations to your project, follow these steps:

<Tabs syncKey="projectType">
  <TabItem label="File-based project">
    <Steps>
      1. Open your project and select **Translations** on the left sidebar.
      1. Click **Upload existing translations** to expand the respective section. <Image src={uploadTranslations} alt="Upload Translations" />
      1. Drag and drop files from your machine, or click **Select Files**. You can upload ZIP archives to add multiple folders and files.
      1. Crowdin Enterprise automatically matches uploaded translations with appropriate source files and languages. Check it manually to make sure everything is matched correctly.
      1. *(Optional)* Configure the system behavior toward the uploaded translations using the advanced import settings. <Image src={uploadTranslationsConfigure} alt="Configure Upload" />
          <Aside>
            By default, translations that match the source strings, translations that are identical to the existing ones, and translations for hidden strings are skipped during the upload.
          </Aside>
      1. Click **Import** to apply the translations to the source files.
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="String-based project">
    <Steps>
      1. Open your project and select **Upload** on the left sidebar.
      1. Drag and drop files from your machine, or click **Select Files**. You can also upload ZIP archives if you want a set of files to be added.
      1. Crowdin Enterprise automatically tries to detect the target language to which you're uploading translations. Check it manually to make sure target languages are matched correctly towards translation files.
      1. *(Optional)* In the **Translations** section, to the right of the uploaded file list, configure advanced translation import settings.
          <Aside>
            By default, translations are uploaded as unapproved, translations that match the source strings, and translations for hidden strings are skipped during the upload.
          </Aside>
      1. Click **Upload** to apply translations to the source strings.
    </Steps>
    <Image src={uploadTranslationsSb} alt="Upload Translations" />
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Uploading Translations via Language Page

<Tabs syncKey="projectType">
  <TabItem label="File-based project">
    <Steps>
      1. Select the language on the project page.
      1. Click <Icon name="mdi:dots-vertical" class="inline-icon" /> next to the file translations should be uploaded to.
      1. Select **Upload Translations**. <Image src={uploadTranslationsLanguagePage} alt="Upload Translations" />

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="String-based project">
    <Aside type="caution" title="Limitations">
      Uploading Translations via Language Page is not supported in [string-based](/enterprise/creating-project/#string-based-project) projects.
    </Aside>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Uploading Translations via Editor

To upload a file with translations via [Online Editor](/enterprise/online-editor/), follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Click on the Main menu <Icon name="mdi:menu" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-left corner.
  2. Go to **File > Upload Translations**. <Image src={uploadTranslationsEditorMenu} alt="Upload Translations in Editor" />
</Steps>

## Uploading XLIFF Translations

You can do the offline translation for all file formats, having downloaded existing content in the XLIFF format. As soon as the offline translations are finished, use **Upload XLIFF Translations**.

To upload XLIFF translations for all files for a specific target language, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Select the language on the project page.
  2. Click <Icon name="mdi:dots-vertical" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-right corner and select **Upload XLIFF Translations**. <Image src={uploadTranslationsXliff} alt="Upload XLIFF Translations" />
</Steps>

For string-based projects, you can upload XLIFF translations using the [Online Editor](#uploading-translations-via-editor).

## Key-value Formats

You can easily upload translations for source files with a key-value structure.

This includes the following file formats: Android XML, macOS/iOS Strings, Stringsdict, JSON, Chrome JSON, GO JSON, i18next JSON, FBT JSON, XLIFF, XLIFF 2.0, Java Properties, Play Properties, Java Properties XML, RESX, RESW, RES JSON, YAML, INI, Joomla INI, JS, FJS, PO, TS, QT TS, TOML, Coffee, XAML, SRT, VTT, VTT2, SBV, SVG, DTD, CSV, RC, WXL, Haml, XLSX, PLIST, PHP, ARB, VDF.

The system maps uploaded translations according to the string keys.

## Text and HTML-based Formats

For files that do not have a defined structure, translation upload is handled by an experimental machine learning technology.

This includes the following file formats: HTML, Front Matter HTML, Markdown, Front Matter Markdown, TXT, Generic XML, Web XML, DOCX, HAML, IDML, DITA, Wiki, and ADOC.

To achieve the best results, we recommend uploading translation files with the same or as close as possible file structure as in source files.

Currently, this feature is available for the following languages (not depending on the language pair combination): Arabic, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, English, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, Portuguese Brazilian, Spanish, Thai, Turkish, and Russian.
