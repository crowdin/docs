Screenshots are a great way to provide translators with additional context for the source strings in your project and, as a result, get more relevant and consistent translations. With screenshots, your team can see which strings are used together on the same page, whether short texts stand for titles, buttons, etc.

Tag source strings to the screenshots to display them to translators in the Editor in the context section below the source string.
