Once your organization is set up and your first project is created, choosing the right translation strategy is critical to ensuring effective and efficient localization. You need to decide who will translate and review the content added to your project, which can significantly impact the quality and turnaround time of your translations.

Each project in Crowdin Enterprise has its own workflow, giving you the flexibility to combine different translation approaches according to your needs. Workflows allow you to optimize the translation process to different content types and localization requirements.

## Use Cases

Use multiple translation methods in parallel or sequentially to find the winning combination for each project:

* Assign in-house translators to the language pairs in which they specialize. Delegate translation into less common target languages to a translation agency.
* Select a Translation Vendor from the Crowdin [Store](https://store.crowdin.com/). Assign them to both translation and proofreading workflow steps.
* Pre-translate files using AI-powered tools or Machine Translation engines to assist your in-house translators.
* Add the **TM Pre-translation** step to the project workflow to translate the same text used in different versions and parts of your product.
* If you have an active community, choose **Crowdsourcing** as one of the workflow steps. Add **Proofreading** as the next step to review translations by professional linguists.

## Assemble In-house Team of Translators

You can invite translators and proofreaders you already work with to your organization or project. These could be:

* In-house translators
* Freelancers
* Translators from the translation agencies you already work with

When assembling your own team, invite each translator and proofreader individually and manage their permissions within your organization. You can assign specific workflow steps and target languages to ensure they only access the relevant resources.

## Send Request to a Translation Vendor

Professional translation agencies can have separate organizations in Crowdin Enterprise. The collaboration between the organizations is based on client-vendor relations. You can choose a vendor from the Crowdin Store or invite the translation agency you already work with to be a vendor for you. For this, the agency should register a separate organization in Crowdin Enterprise.

The good thing about cooperation with a Vendor organization is that there’s no need to invite each of the agency’s translators and proofreaders to your organization or project. You invite only the vendor organization, which receives a secured copy of the workflow steps it was assigned to as an incoming project. Once the incoming project is accepted, they will be able to assign their workflow and specific translators, which will not influence your project’s workflow in any way. All their translations will be marked as translations done by that vendor, not specific people.

Professional translation services offer high-quality and efficient localization. These services are paid, so be sure to discuss rates and project costs with the vendor before starting the cooperation.

## Pre-translate via AI, Machine Translation, or Translation Memory

AI-powered pre-translation tools, Machine Translation (MT) engines, and Translation Memory (TM) are all effective methods for pre-translating project files. Each method offers unique benefits for assisting human translators, speeding up localization, and reducing translation costs. After the pre-translation, human translators can review and refine these translations to ensure high-quality results.

### AI-powered Pre-Translation

Crowdin Enterprise integrates with top AI providers such as OpenAI, Google Gemini, Microsoft Azure OpenAI, and more. AI-powered translations provide context-aware and high-quality translations that significantly enhance efficiency.

You can expand your AI provider options by installing respective applications from the Crowdin [Store](https://store.crowdin.com/tags/ai).

### Machine Translation (MT) Engines

Crowdin Enterprise supports integration with the most popular MT engines, including Google Translate and AutoML Translation, Microsoft Translator, DeepL Pro, and Amazon Translate.

Similarly to AI providers, you can add more MT engines of your choice from the Crowdin [Store](https://store.crowdin.com/tags/mt).

### Translation Memory (TM)

Translation Memory stores source strings and their translations into various languages. TM is automatically created for each Crowdin Enterprise project, and you can also upload your existing TMs.

TM pre-translation helps you speed up the translation process by leveraging previously translated content, which is especially useful for translating repeated or similar strings, thereby reducing translation costs.

## Engage Your Community

Crowdsourcing is a localization practice that engages your product's community to translate your content. Translations made by community members can be reviewed by professional linguists or go directly to production. Invite your community via social media or other communication channels you use.
