## Pre-translation via AI

Pre-translation via AI allows you to use AI Models to pre-translate your content with high-quality, context-aware translations.

<LinkCard
  title="Pre-translation"
  description="Explore various pre-translation options to speed up your project localization."
  href="/enterprise/pre-translation/"
/>

<Aside type="tip">
  You can also [configure the AI Pre-translation workflow step](/enterprise/workflows/) for new content in your project.
</Aside>

## Using AI in the Editor

After configuring a prompt with the **AI in editor** type, Crowdin AI can be used in the Editor as an AI Assistant for translators and proofreaders. This AI Assistant can be communicated with in a chat format, allowing you to send prompts and receive replies.

The AI Assistant is context-aware, meaning it knows the string the translator is working on, the related glossaries, TM matches, the maximum acceptable length of the translation, the related screenshots, etc. This contextual awareness enables the AI Assistant to provide more accurate and relevant assistance.

Here are some tasks the AI Assistant can help with:

* Correcting TM suggestions: If you get a 60% match, the AI Assistant can improve the remaining 40%, ensuring consistency with your terminology and previous translations.
* Serving as an advanced dictionary: The AI Assistant can provide term definitions, translation variants, synonyms, and more.
* Suggesting translations: Similar to other MT tools, the AI Assistant can suggest translations which you can further refine based on your specific needs or save as is.

In addition, the AI Assistant can help in translating knowledge base articles by providing short summaries, helping you grasp the content quickly before translating.

When working in the Editor, you can start using the AI Assistant by clicking the AI Assistant tab in the right sidebar.

<Image src={aiEditor} alt="AI Assistant in the Editor" />

For faster and more efficient interaction with the AI Assistant, you can use prompt shortcuts. By default, there are three prompt shortcuts available:

* Rephrase
* Shorten
* Translate all

To add your own prompt shortcuts, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Click <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon"/> in the upper-right corner to open the AI settings.
  2. Click <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon"/> **Add shortcut**.
  3. Specify a shortcut name and a prompt it will be using.
  4. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

Additionally, in the **Editor Settings > AI** tab, you can create a custom prompt to provide the AI Assistant with a specific set of instructions that are sent each time you make a request. Note that the custom prompt is project-specific.

<Image src={aiEditorSettings} alt="AI Assistant Editor Settings" class="width-lg" />

When sending prompts to the AI Assistant, the instruction priorities are considered in the following order:

1. Instructions specified in the [**AI in editor** prompt settings](#configuring-ai-prompts).
2. Instructions specified in the custom prompt settings.
3. Instructions specified in the prompt shortcut or manually entered in the AI Assistant chat.

## AI Alignment

AI Alignment uses AI to analyze human translations, automatically generating glossary term drafts based on recurring terminology patterns. These terms add valuable context for both translators and AI, supporting consistent terminology across all project translations. Note that AI Alignment only analyzes translations submitted by users in the Editor or those uploaded to the project; pre-translations are not considered.

<Aside>
  AI Alignment is available only for the Business [subscription plan](https://crowdin.com/pricing#enterprise-plans) on Crowdin Enterprise.
</Aside>

### How AI Alignment Works

When a translator submits a translation, AI Alignment analyzes the terminology used to identify and suggest draft glossary terms. This process involves reviewing translations for recurring terms and phrases that represent core project terminology. AI Alignment then generates glossary records in simplified forms (e.g., `location` rather than `locations`) to create a unified set of terms for the project.

For example, in a project with the source string `Remove this location`, the initial AI suggestion for translation might be `Видалити це місце`. However, a human translator chooses `Видалити цю локацію`, using `локація` consistently for `location`. Based on this choice, AI Alignment creates a draft glossary term that pairs `location` with `локація`.

Later, when another source string `Add location` is translated, the AI now aligns with this glossary term and suggests `Додати локацію`, ensuring consistency. This will happen if the AI Prompt for AI Suggestion in editor is set to consider glossary terms.

Additionally, when human translators encounter source strings that contain `location`, they will see the glossary term `location` along with its translation `локація`. This helps translators use the preferred terminology, enhancing consistency across the project.

If an existing term differs from the suggested AI translation, AI Alignment will add a draft term to the current record, allowing project managers to review and confirm preferred terminology. This approach ensures new terms don’t overwrite or conflict with established glossary records.

### Setting Up AI Alignment

To use AI Alignment, [configure a prompt](#configuring-ai-prompts) with the **Alignment** type and [apply it](/enterprise/project-settings/ai/#selecting-ai-prompts) to the needed projects. This prompt type enables AI Alignment to process and generate draft glossary terms as translators add their translation suggestions.

In Advanced mode, project managers can further customize specific criteria for generating glossary terms from translations. This includes filtering terms to draft only those relevant to specific domains or adjusting tolerance levels to minimize irrelevant suggestions. Such customization allows AI Alignment to focus on essential terminology for the project.

For example, managers can set AI Alignment to create term drafts only for industry-specific terminology, ensuring that only relevant records are included.

Once configured, all draft terms generated by AI Alignment appear in the glossary with a draft status, allowing managers to review and confirm these terms before they become part of the active glossary. This review step provides control over terminology consistency and accuracy across the project.

## AI QA Check

AI QA Check uses AI to automatically evaluate translations against defined quality standards. It helps translators quickly identify and resolve issues, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and compliance with project-specific requirements. AI QA Check complements and extends other QA methods (i.e., default QA Checks, Custom QA Checks, and External QA Checks) by providing comprehensive flexibility, reducing manual review efforts, and enhancing overall translation quality.

### How AI QA Check Works

When enabled, AI QA Check evaluates each submitted translation against a set of customizable evaluation criteria (Evaluation steps) defined in the configured QA Check prompt. Issues detected by the AI appear directly within the Editor as warnings, along with concise suggestions for corrections.

Evaluation steps may include:

* **Accuracy** – Ensuring no content is omitted, added, or incorrectly translated.
* **Fluency** – Checking grammar, spelling, punctuation, and readability.
* **Terminology** – Confirming consistent and correct use of project-specific terms.
* **Style** – Verifying translations align with defined stylistic guidelines.
* **Design** – Ensuring translations fit design constraints, including length and markup.
* **Locale Convention** – Adapting formats for dates, currencies, addresses, and more.
* **Cultural Adaptation (Verity)** – Localizing culture-specific references appropriately.
* **General Issues** – Identifying other miscellaneous quality issues.

For example, if a translation deviates from established glossary terms or fails to meet local formatting standards, the AI will highlight this and offer recommendations, guiding translators to achieve compliance and consistency.

### Setting Up AI QA Check

To use AI QA Check, create and configure a [QA Check prompt](#configuring-ai-prompts). Each QA Check prompt contains clearly defined evaluation steps the AI follows to detect translation issues. Unlike other AI prompts, the QA Check prompt includes a dedicated **Evaluation steps** section, allowing you to customize, edit, or expand upon predefined checks.

You can also enhance the accuracy of the AI’s analysis by including various types of additional context relevant to your project's content.

After configuration, you can assign a QA Check prompt as the default for either your entire organization or individual projects.

### Applying AI QA Check in Projects

To enable AI QA Check in your projects, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. [Create and enable a QA Check prompt](#configuring-ai-prompts).
  2. Set it as the default QA prompt in the project's **Settings > AI > Settings**.
  3. Enable the **AI-powered check** in the project's **Settings > QA Checks**.
</Steps>

Once set, the AI continuously checks submitted translations, ensuring consistent compliance with your project's quality guidelines.
