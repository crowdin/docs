Pre-translation helps speed up the translation process and ease the work of translators. It also allows you to save funds as part of translations can be automated. You can use and combine the following types of pre-translation:

- **AI Pre-Translate** - uses AI Models to pre-translate the content.
- **Machine Translation (MT) Pre-translate** – takes translations from supported machine translation engines (MTE) and applies them to the project content. You need to configure at least one of the translation engines to enable this feature.
- **Translation Memory (TM) Pre-translate** –  takes translations from the TM vault uploaded to the system and applies them to project content.

<Aside type="tip">
  Use the [Pre-translation Efficiency](/enterprise/project-reports/#pre-translation-efficiency) report to test which pre-translation methods work the best for your content.

## Manual Pre-translation

To apply Pre-translation manually, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to the **Dashboard** tab.
  1. Click **Pre-translate** and select the preferred method (i.e., via Translation Memory, via Machine Translation, or AI). <Image src={preTranslateMethod} alt="Pre-Translation Method" width="400px" />
  1. Configure settings for pre-translation.
      * For pre-translation via TM:  
        * Target languages
        * Files for pre-translation
        * Pre-translation parameters (minimum match ratio, strings for translation, approval options, label filters)
      * For pre-translation via MT:
        * MT engine
        * Target languages
        * Files for pre-translation
        * Pre-translation parameters (strings for translation, filtering with labels)
      * For pre-translation via AI:
        * AI prompt
        * Target languages
        * Files for pre-translation
        * Pre-translation parameters (strings for translation, filtering with labels)
  1. Click **Pre-Translate**.
</Steps>

<Aside>
  If the [TM Auto-substitution](/enterprise/translation-memory/#tm-auto-substitution) feature is enabled when pre-translating via TM, it means that TM suggestions improved to 100% will be treated as regular 100% matches.

## Automatic Pre-translation

When working with [projects with a workflow](/enterprise/creating-project/#projects-with-a-workflow), you can add AI Pre-translation, MT Pre-translation, or TM Pre-translation workflow steps to your project workflow to automate the Pre-translation of your content.
