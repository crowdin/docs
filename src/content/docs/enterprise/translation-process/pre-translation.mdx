Pre-translation helps speed up the translation process and ease the work of translators. It also allows you to save funds as part of translations can be automated. You can use and combine the following types of pre-translation:

- **AI Pre-Translate** - uses AI Models to pre-translate the content.
- **Machine Translation (MT) Pre-translate** – takes translations from supported machine translation engines (MTE) and applies them to the project content. You need to configure at least one of the translation engines to enable this feature.
- **Translation Memory (TM) Pre-translate** –  takes translations from the TM vault uploaded to the system and applies them to project content.

  Use the [Pre-translation Efficiency](/enterprise/project-reports/#pre-translation-efficiency) report to test which pre-translation methods work the best for your content.

## Manual Pre-translation

To apply Pre-translation manually, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and select **Dashboard** on the left sidebar.
  1. Click **Pre-translate** and select the preferred method (i.e., via Translation Memory, via Machine Translation, or AI). <Image src={preTranslateMethod} alt="Pre-Translation Method" />
  1. Configure settings for pre-translation.
      * For pre-translation via TM:
        * Target languages
        * Files for pre-translation
        * Pre-translation parameters (minimum match ratio, strings for translation, approval options, label filters)
      * For pre-translation via MT:
        * MT engine
        * Target languages
        * Files for pre-translation
        * Pre-translation parameters (strings for translation, filtering with labels)
      * For pre-translation via AI:
        * AI prompt
        * Target languages
        * Files for pre-translation
        * Pre-translation parameters (strings for translation, filtering with labels)
  1. Click **Pre-Translate**.
</Steps>

<Aside>
  If the [TM Auto-substitution](/enterprise/translation-memory/#tm-auto-substitution) feature is enabled when pre-translating via TM, it means that TM suggestions improved to 100% will be treated as regular 100% matches.

### Pre-translation Queue

The Pre-translation queue allows you to trigger multiple manual pre-translations via TM, MT, or AI, each with different settings. After initiating a pre-translation, each instance enters a queue with a status of **Pending**.

Upon triggering a manual pre-translation, you will receive a notification indicating that the pre-translation has been added to the queue. To review all pre-translations currently in the queue, navigate to **Tools > Pre-translation queue** in your project. Alternatively, click **Pre-translation** in the project's **Dashboard** and select **Queue** to be redirected directly to the **Tools > Pre-translation queue**.

Each entry in the Pre-translation queue table includes the following details:

- **Created at:** Displays the date and time when the pre-translation was initiated
- **Type:** TM, MT (MT engine name), AI (AI prompt name)
- **Status:** Pending, In progress, Completed, Canceled

You can cancel any pre-translation that is still in the queue if needed. Additionally, for completed pre-translations, you can view a report detailing the target languages, number of translations added and skipped, file list, and more.

## Automatic Pre-translation

When working with [projects with a workflow](/enterprise/creating-project/#projects-with-a-workflow), you can add AI Pre-translation, MT Pre-translation, or TM Pre-translation workflow steps to your project workflow to automate the Pre-translation of your content.

## Handling QA Issues During Pre-translation via AI

If the AI provider returns translations with QA issues during pre-translation, Crowdin Enterprise will collect the strings to which these faulty translations were applied and automatically reinitiate the pre-translation. The affected strings will be sent back to the AI provider along with details of the detected QA issues to ensure that the translations are corrected and meet quality standards.

## Q&A

<QuestionAnswer title="My project workflow includes a Switch Source Language step (e.g., switching from Tamil to English) followed by the TM Pre-translation step. Which source language will be used for automatic and manual pre-translation?">
  When a **Switch Source Language** step is included in the workflow, the behavior of pre-translation depends on how it's triggered.

  - **Manual pre-translation** will always use the initial project source language (Tamil in this case).
  - **Workflow-based pre-translation** (e.g., an automatic TM pre-translation after the source language switch) will use the switched source language (English).

  This applies to TM, MT, and AI pre-translations. To use English as the source, rely on the workflow's automatic pre-translation step after switching the source language.
