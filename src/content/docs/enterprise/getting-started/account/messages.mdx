Communicate with your organization members using Messages. Create one-to-one or team conversations.

## Creating a new conversation

To create a new conversation, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Go to **Messages**.
  1. Click <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" />**New Chat** and select the users you want to add to the conversation.
  1. Click **Create**.
</Steps>

## Conversations

Using the <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon" /> icon each conversation member can:

- _View members_ of the conversation.
- _Rename conversation_ to easily navigate between conversations. By default, the subject consists of the users’ names.
- _Mute conversation_ to stop receiving notifications about new messages.

<Aside title="Limitations">
  So far, there is no possibility to delete conversations or add new users to the existing chat, but we are working on improving it soon.

## Manage messages

To access messages management tools hover over a specific message and click <Icon name="mdi:dots-vertical" class="inline-icon" /> button.

<Image src={manageMessages} alt="Manage messages" />

Using this drop-down menu you can:

- _Share_ the message:
  - in the same conversation to cite something that was said before
  - in any other existing conversations
  - with any other user
- _Report spam_ (only available for the messages received from other people)
- _Edit_ messages (only your own)
- _Delete_ messages (only your own)
- _Mark unread_ &ndash; if you want to return to the message later on. The number of unread messages in each channel is displayed next to the channel’s subject.

You will see the total amount of unread messages in the top right of the page next to _Messages_ icon and in the left-hand side menu correspondingly.
