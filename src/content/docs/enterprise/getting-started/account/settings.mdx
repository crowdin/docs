### Password

To change your password, click **Password**, enter your current password, and set a new one. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

### Authenticator App

Activate two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an additional layer of security to your Crowdin Enterprise account. Use an authenticator app on your mobile device or computer to generate one-time verification codes.

To enable two-factor authentication, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your **Account Settings** and go to the **Security** tab.
  2. Click **Authenticator App**.
  3. Using the **Google Authenticator** app on your mobile device, scan the QR code on the screen.

  5. Download recovery codes, so you can use them if you can't access your mobile device.
</Steps>

### Connected Applications

Manage the applications you've authorized to use your account. You can view a list of connected applications and revoke access as needed.

### Security Keys and Passkey

In the **Security Keys and Passkey** section, you can register a physical security key or passkey to add an extra layer of protection to your account. This key works alongside your password to verify your identity during login.

### Device Verification

Enable **Device Verification** to add an extra security step when logging in from a new device. Crowdin Enterprise will send a verification code to your registered email address to confirm your identity before allowing access from the new device. Once you successfully log in, the device will be added to the list of trusted devices.

<Aside>
  You can disable this option only if you are using any 2FA, like Authenticator app or Security Keys.
</Aside>

After enabling this feature, you will see a list of trusted devices. You can remove any device from the list by clicking the **Remove** button. Alternatively, you can remove all trusted devices by clicking **Remove All**.

### Auth Providers

In the **Auth providers** section, you can manage the accounts linked to your Crowdin Enterprise account. These connections allow you to log in with a single click using providers like Google, Facebook, GitHub, X, and GitLab.

### Security Log

The **Security Log** section lets you track important events (including event type, used device, IP address, and date) that happen with your Crowdin Enterprise account.

Security log includes events like logins, password and username changes, and others.

### Sessions

In the **Sessions** section, you can view the list of devices that have accessed your Crowdin Enterprise account, including details like location, last activity date, IP address, and device type. Revoke individual sessions that you don't recognize, or revoke all except your current session by clicking **Revoke All**.

### Sudo Mode

Crowdin Enterprise asks you to confirm your password before performing sensitive actions, such as changing your password, managing email or authentication settings, and deleting your account. Once confirmed, you can perform these actions without re-authenticating for the next five minutes.

## Access Tokens

Personal access tokens serve as alternative passwords for authorizing third-party applications and scripts in Crowdin Enterprise.

<Image src={tokens} alt="Access Tokens" />

<Aside type="caution">
  Treat personal access tokens like passwords and keep them secure. Use tokens as environment variables instead of hardcoding them into your scripts.
</Aside>

### Use Cases

A personal access token is required for authorization in Crowdin Enterprise in the following situations:

* To automate localization workflow via [Crowdin Enterprise API](https://support.crowdin.com/enterprise/api/).
* To use [Crowdin CLI](https://crowdin.github.io/crowdin-cli/) for managing and synchronizing localization resources in Crowdin Enterprise.
* To use Figma plugin to push your designs to Crowdin Enterprise.
* To use Android Studio plugin to pull source content you specify from your Android project.
* etc.

### Creating a Personal Access Token

When creating a new personal access token, you can select [specific scopes](/developer/understanding-scopes/) and, if needed, limit the visibility of resources for the selected scopes using the **Granular access** option. For example, you can create a token that should interact only with a specific project or group and have no access to others. As a result, only the selected items will be gained when retrieving a list of all projects or groups.

To create a new personal access token, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your **Account Settings** and go to the **Access tokens** tab.
  1. Click **New Token**.
  1. In the appeared dialog, specify the token name to be able to identify it later.
  1. Select the necessary set of scopes.
  1. *(Optional)* To limit access to specific resources, select **Granular access**. <Aside>If **Granular access** is selected, ensure to select some resources for the selected scopes.</Aside>
  1. Depending on the selected scopes, select **Grant access to selected projects**, **Grant access to selected TMs**, and **Grant access to selected Glossaries**.
  1. Click **Select Groups**, **Select projects**, **Select glossaries**, **Select TMs**, and respectively select the needed resources. <Aside>When selecting a group, personal access token will automatically gain access to group's projects and resources.</Aside>
  1. Click **Create**.
</Steps>

After creating a new token, be sure to record it immediately. For security reasons, it will not be shown again. You can create as many personal access tokens as you need from your Crowdin Enterprise account.

<Aside type="caution">
  If a resource wasn't selected during the personal access token creation, and you attempt to access it using its ID, you will receive a `404 Not Found` response.
</Aside>

### Revoking a Personal Access Token

You may need to revoke a personal access token if you no longer use it or suspect it has been compromised.

To revoke a personal access token, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your **Account Settings** and go to the **Access tokens** tab.
  1. Find the necessary token in the list and click **Revoke** next to it to delete the personal access token and remove its access.
</Steps>
