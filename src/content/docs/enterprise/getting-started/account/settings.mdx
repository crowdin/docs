### Connected Applications

### Security Keys and Passkey

A security key is a physical device that adds an extra layer of security to your online accounts. It is used in conjunction with a password or other authentication method to confirm your identity during the sign-in process.

### Device Verification

When logging in from a new device, we'll ask for email confirmation and send a verification code. Once you successfully log in, the device will be added to the list of trusted devices.

Click **Enable New Device Verification** to enable this feature.

<Aside>
  You can disable this option only if you are using any 2FA, like Authenticator app or Security Keys
</Aside>

After enabling this feature, you will see a list of trusted devices. You can remove any device from the list by clicking the **Remove** button. Alternatively, you can remove all trusted devices by clicking **Remove All**.

### Auth Providers

In the **Auth Providers** section, you can connect your Facebook, Google, X, GitHub, or GitLab accounts to log into your Crowdin Enterprise account with one click.

### Security Log

The **Security Log** section lets you track important events (including event type, used device, IP address, and date) that happen with your Crowdin Enterprise account.

Security log includes events like logins, password and username changes, and others.

### Sessions

In the **Sessions** section, you can review the list of devices (including the location, last activity date, IP address, browser, and operating system) logged into your Crowdin Enterprise account.

If there are any sessions you don't recognize, you can revoke them by clicking **Revoke** on the specific session. Alternatively, you can revoke all but the active session by clicking **Revoke All**.

### Sudo Mode

Crowdin Enterprise asks you to confirm your password before you can perform any of the sudo-protected actions that include creating/changing your password and email, connecting/disconnecting SSO, enabling/disabling two-factor authentication, creating personal access tokens, and deleting your account.

After you've confirmed your password, you’ll be able to perform the sudo-protected actions without additional re-authentication within the next five minutes.

## Access Tokens

Personal access tokens are the alternative passwords you can use to authorize third-party applications and scripts into Crowdin Enterprise.

<Image src={tokens} alt="Access Tokens" />

<Aside type="caution">
  Treat personal access tokens like passwords and keep them secret. Use tokens as environmental variables instead of hardcoding them into your scripts.
</Aside>

### Use Cases

A personal access token is required for authorization in Crowdin Enterprise in the following situations:

* To automate localization workflow via [Crowdin Enterprise API](https://support.crowdin.com/enterprise/api/).
* To use [Crowdin CLI](https://crowdin.github.io/crowdin-cli/) for managing and synchronizing localization resources in Crowdin Enterprise.
* To use Figma plugin to push your designs to Crowdin Enterprise.
* To use Android Studio plugin to pull source content you specify from your Android project.
* etc.

### Creating a Personal Access Token

When creating a new personal access token, you can select [specific scopes](/developer/understanding-scopes/) and, if needed, limit the visibility of resources for the selected scopes  using the **Granular access** option. For example, you can create a token that should interact only with a specific project or group and have no access to others. As a result, only the selected items will be gained when retrieving a list of all projects or groups.

To create a new personal access token, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your **Account Settings** and go to the **Access tokens** tab.
  1. Click **New Token**.
  1. In the appeared dialog, specify the token name to be able to identify it later.
  1. Select the necessary set of scopes.
  1. *(Optional)* To limit access to specific resources, select **Granular access**. <Aside>If **Granular access** is selected, ensure to select some resources for the selected scopes.</Aside>
  1. Depending on the selected scopes, select **Grant access to selected projects**, **Grant access to selected TMs**, and **Grant access to selected Glossaries**.
  1. Click **Select Groups**, **Select projects**, **Select glossaries**, **Select TMs**, and respectively select the needed resources. <Aside>When selecting a group, personal access token will automatically gain access to group's projects and resources.</Aside>
  1. Click **Create**.
</Steps>

After generating a new token, be sure to record it right away. For security purposes, it will not be shown again. You can create as many personal access tokens as you need from your Crowdin Enterprise account.

<Aside type="caution">
  If a resource wasn't selected during the personal access token creation, but you still try to access it with its ID, the `404 Not Found` response will be received.
</Aside>

### Revoking a Personal Access Token

You might need to revoke a personal access token if you no longer use it or suspect it has been compromised. To revoke a personal access token, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your **Account Settings** and go to the **Access tokens** tab.
  1. Find the necessary token in the list and click **Revoke** next to it to delete a personal access token and remove its access.
</Steps>
