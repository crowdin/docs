## Appearance

Choose how Crowdin Enterprise appears on your device. You can select a Light or Dark theme or sync it with your system settings to switch automatically between day and night modes.

<Image src={themeSettings} alt="Appearance Settings" class="width-2xl" />

## My Rate Templates

On the **My rate templates** page, you can create and manage personal templates for report settings. These templates are visible only in your profile and can be used when generating **Cost Estimate** and **Translation Cost** reports.

Each template can include:

* **Base rates** – Set rates for full translation and proofreading. Applied to all languages by default.
* **Net Rate Schemes** – Set percentage rates for TM, MT, AI, and other match types, based on the full translation rate.
* **Custom rates** – Add language-specific (and in some cases, user-specific) rate configurations.
* **Additional options** – Include or exclude pre-translated strings, adjust how repetitive translations are categorized, and calculate internal fuzzy matches.

Saved templates help standardize your rate setup and make it easy to reuse configurations across reports. To use a saved template, click **Templates** when configuring your report and select the one you'd like to apply.

To create a new rate template, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Go to **Account Settings > My rate templates**.
  2. Click **Add Rates Template**.
  3. Enter a template name and define your base rates and net rate schemes.
  4. *(Optional)* Add custom rates for specific languages.
  5. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

## Security

Change your current password, manage two-factor authentication for the Account, and check linked applications. You can also control authentication for external services and log out of all the devices.

<Image src={securitySettings} alt="Security Settings" class="width-2xl" />

### Password

To change your password, click **Password**, enter your current password, and set a new one. Click **Save** to apply the changes.

### Authenticator App

Activate two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an additional layer of security to your Crowdin Enterprise account. Use an authenticator app on your mobile device or computer to generate one-time verification codes.

To enable two-factor authentication, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your **Account Settings** and select **Security** on the left sidebar.
  2. Click **Authenticator app**.
  3. Using the **Google Authenticator** app on your mobile device, scan the QR code on the screen.
  4. Enter the 6-digit verification code generated by your authenticator app, then click **Submit**.
  5. Download recovery codes, so you can use them if you can't access your mobile device.
</Steps>

### Connected Applications

Manage third-party apps you've authorized to access your Crowdin Enterprise account. You can view a list of connected apps and revoke access as needed.

### Security Keys and Passkey

Register a physical security key or passkey to strengthen your account protection. These can be used alongside your password to verify your identity during login.

### Device Verification

Enable **Device Verification** to require identity confirmation when logging in from a new device. A verification code will be sent to your registered email address, and the device will be added to your trusted list once verified.

<Aside>
  You can disable this option only if at least one 2FA method (such as the Authenticator app or a security key) is enabled.
</Aside>

You can manage trusted devices by removing individual entries or clicking **Remove All** to clear the list.

### Auth Providers

Manage external accounts linked to your Crowdin Enterprise account. You can connect services like Google, Facebook, GitHub, X, or GitLab to enable one-click login.

### Security Log

View a list of important account events, such as logins, password changes, authentication updates, and more. Each entry includes the event type, device, IP address, and timestamp.

### Sessions

View a list of devices that have accessed your Crowdin Enterprise account, along with details like location, last activity, IP address, and device type. You can revoke individual sessions or click **Revoke All** to end all sessions except the current one.

### Sudo Mode

Crowdin Enterprise may ask you to confirm your password before performing sensitive actions, such as changing your password, email, or authentication settings. Once verified, you’ll stay in sudo mode for five minutes without needing to re-authenticate.

## Notifications

On the **Notifications** page, you can customize which notifications you receive and how they are delivered. You can choose delivery channels, select relevant events, and apply project-level preferences.

### Channels & Events

Crowdin Enterprise provides several channels for notifications:

* In-App (Crowdin Enterprise)
* Email
* Slack
* Custom Notifications

To customize notifications, click the arrow next to a channel name and select the events you want to be notified about.

### Notification Rules for Projects

You can adjust notifications for each project:

* **Global** – Receive all selected notification types.
* **Mentions only** – Only receive notifications when @mentioned.
* **Mute project** – Turn off all notifications for the project.

## Access Tokens

Personal access tokens serve as an alternative to passwords for authorizing third-party applications and scripts in Crowdin Enterprise.

<Image src={tokens} alt="Access Tokens" />

<Aside type="caution">
  Treat personal access tokens like passwords. Store them securely and avoid hardcoding them into scripts. Use environment variables instead.
</Aside>

### Use Cases

You’ll need a personal access token for authorization in the following cases:

* Automating localization workflows via the [Crowdin API](/developer/api/).
* Managing and syncing localization resources with the [Crowdin CLI](https://crowdin.github.io/crowdin-cli/).
* Pushing design content for translation from design tools (i.e., Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD).
* Uploading and downloading content using IDE plugins (i.e., Visual Studio Code, Android Studio).
* And other integrations or tools that require secure access to your Crowdin Enterprise account.

### Creating a Personal Access Token

When creating a new personal access token, you can select [specific scopes](/developer/understanding-scopes/) and, if needed, limit access to specific resources using the **Granular access** option. For example, you can create a token that interacts only with a specific project or group. When listing all projects or groups via the API, only selected items will be returned.

To create a new personal access token, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your **Account Settings** and select **Access tokens** on the left sidebar.
  1. Click **New Token**.
  1. In the appeared dialog, enter a name to help you identify the token later.
  1. Select the required scopes.
  1. *(Optional)* Enable **Granular access** to restrict the token’s access to specific resources. <Aside>If you enable **Granular access**, make sure to select at least one resource for each selected scope.</Aside>
  1. Depending on the selected scopes, select **Grant access to selected projects**, **Grant access to selected TMs**, and **Grant access to selected Glossaries**.
  1. Click **Select Groups**, **Select projects**, **Select glossaries**, **Select TMs**, and respectively select the needed resources. <Aside>When selecting a group, personal access token will automatically gain access to group's projects and resources.</Aside>
  1. Click **Create**.
</Steps>

After creating a token, make sure to copy and store it securely — for security reasons, it won't be shown again. You can create as many personal access tokens as needed.

<Aside type="caution">
  If a resource wasn't selected during token creation, attempting to access it by ID will result in a <code style="white-space: nowrap">404 Not Found</code> error.
</Aside>

### Revoking a Personal Access Token

Revoke a personal access token if it’s no longer needed or you suspect it was compromised.

To revoke a personal access token, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your **Account Settings** and select **Access tokens** on the left sidebar.
  1. Find the token in the list and click **Revoke** next to it to remove its access.
</Steps>
