> Crowdin Enterprise is a cloud-based solution for streamlined localization management. Our technology solution allows you to localize your software, games, documentation, and other products.

You can upload your translatable content and automate its updates, collaborate with your in-house translators, outsource translations, keep track of translation progress in real-time, and seamlessly integrate completed translations into your products.

We've created this quick start guide to help you get the most out of your Crowdin Enterprise experience. This article will assist you in getting started with Crowdin Enterprise to grow your business, and we'll provide some helpful resources you can use along the way. Ready to get started?

## Create a Project

Open your organization's **Workspace**, hover over the **Create** button at the bottom right, and select **Project**.

<Image src={createProject} alt="Create a project" />

  Read more about [Creating a Project](/enterprise/creating-project/).
</ReadMore>

Once you've created a project, you can add content to be translated. Each project has its own source content, resources, target languages, integrations, members, etc.

In Crowdin Enterprise, most users create separate projects for different kinds of products or content. For example, you can create individual projects for your mobile application, website, desktop application, and documentation. This allows you to set up different workflows, as some projects can be translated by machine and post-edited by real people. Others may require multiple translation teams and additional proofreading steps.

All your projects are created and managed within an organization. They are only available to members of the organization or to a vendor organization if you invite one.

## Upload Content

Once you've created the project, upload localizable files and resources, such as screenshots, translation memory, and glossary.

### Upload Source Files for Localization

You can upload localizable files in a way that works best for you:

* Manually via the web interface (UI).
* Integrate Crowdin Enterprise with the tools you already use:
  * Repo *(GitHub, GitLab, etc.)*
  * Marketing tools *(Contentful, Webflow, WPML, Hubspot, Marketo, etc.)*
  * Help center *(Help Scout, Zendesk, Intercom, etc.)*
  * Development tools *(VS Code, Android Studio, Google Play, etc.)*
  * Email automation *(MailChimp, SendPulse, ActiveCampaign, Mandrill, Moosend, etc.)*
  * Design tools *(Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD)*.
* Use API or console client.

To automatically sync files between your Crowdin Enterprise project and the tools of your choice, add and set up the respective integration. Once you add the integration, you can proceed to the setup.

### Upload Existing Translations

If you already have some translations done outside Crowdin Enterprise, you can upload them to your Crowdin Enterprise project to keep everything in one place and continue working on translations.

<ReadMore>
  Read more about [Uploading Existing Translations](/enterprise/uploading-translations/).
</ReadMore>

### Upload Localization Resources

All resources, including TMs, Glossaries, and MT engines, can be added to your Workspace or directly to the project. Resources added to Workspace are available to all projects within your organization. Each project also has a default Translation Memory and Glossary that are created automatically.

You can also switch to **Permission granularity mode**, where you can add different resources to each group as well. Resources added to a group will be available only to the projects in this group.

<ReadMore>
  Read more about [Groups](/enterprise/groups/) and [Permission Granularity Mode](/enterprise/permissions-granularity-mode/).
</ReadMore>

#### Translation Memory

With Translation Memory, you can leverage previous translations from your project. When the same or similar texts are used across your content, you can use the same translation and thus save your time. Pre-translate your project with a TM, and previous translations will be reused. Translators can also check how similar strings were translated earlier to keep translations consistent.

Project Translation Memory (TM) is created automatically for each project. You can also upload your existing TMs in TMX, XLSX, and CSV file formats.

<ReadMore>
  Read more about [Translation Memory](/enterprise/translation-memory/).
</ReadMore>

#### Glossary

Use a Glossary to make sure your product terminology is translated correctly and used consistently across all languages.

Project Glossary is created automatically for each project. You can also upload your existing Glossary TBX, XLSX, and CSV file formats.

<ReadMore>
  Read more about [Glossary](/enterprise/glossary/).
</ReadMore>

### Upload Screenshots

Screenshots are another great way to provide additional context so translators can understand better how they should translate the source strings. To upload screenshots, open your project and go to the **Screenshots** section. Tag the source strings on the screenshots. This way, screenshots with tagged strings will appear under each string in the Editor's Context and Translations section.

## Pre-translate Your Project

To save time, you can pre-translate your Crowdin Enterprise project using [Translation Memory](/enterprise/translation-memory/), [Machine Translation](/enterprise/machine-translation/), or [AI](/enterprise/crowdin-ai/). Pre-translating your content means some strings will already be translated before translators begin their work.

You can apply pre-translation manually or set up automatic pre-translation through the project workflow. [Projects without a workflow](/enterprise/creating-project/#projects-without-a-workflow) support manual pre-translation only.

## Invite People

Translate your projects with the right teams and technologies involved. You can invite your in-house translators, freelancers, translation agencies, and your community.

In Crowdin Enterprise, you can invite people to your organization or directly to a specific project. Project members can be assigned contributor or manager roles. Also, you can invite managers directly to groups on the organizational level.

<ReadMore>
  Read more about [Roles](/enterprise/roles/).
</ReadMore>

### User Management

People invited into your organization will see an empty Workspace by default, except for Crowdsourcing projects, which are visible to all the organization members.

To invite people to your organization, open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Users** on the left sidebar.

<Image src={userManagementAddUsers} alt="Add users" />

<ReadMore>
  Read more about [Inviting People](/enterprise/inviting-people/).
</ReadMore>

Once you invite people to your organization, youâ€™ll be able to assign them to workflow steps, add to projects, give them admin or manager access, and more.

### Inviting Existing Organization as Vendor

To start cooperation with a Vendor organization, you first invite them to your organization and then assign to workflow steps. When you work with a vendor, you don't see the specific people who did the translations. Instead, you see which vendor organization did them.

Translation agencies can have their own Vendor organizations in Crowdin Enterprise. If the agency you cooperate with already has an organization, you can invite them; if not - they can also create an organization and then [contact our support](https://crowdin.com/contacts), so we can convert their organization to a Vendor.

This way, you'll be able to have more control over projects and resources you share, an ability to create complex workflows that would include translation and proofreading by vendor and more.

Vendor organization receives a copy of your project in the **Incoming Projects** section. This organization should accept the incoming project to receive the workflow step you invite them to and can independently set their own workflows and invite their own contributors.

To invite a Vendor to your organization, open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Vendors** on the left sidebar.

<ReadMore>
  Read more about [Vendors](/enterprise/vendors/).
</ReadMore>

### Crowdsourcing

Crowdsourcing is a localization practice that engages your community for a common goal â€“ to translate your product on a volunteer basis into several languages. Cooperate with translators, proofreaders, and other enthusiasts on a volunteer basis and reward them for their efforts in a way that works for both of you.

<ReadMore>
  Read more about [Crowdsourcing](/enterprise/crowdsourcing/).
</ReadMore>

## Configure Workflow

Workflow is a combination of steps that content in your project goes through before itâ€™s ready to be used in your product.

You can create a workflow template that works best for you and then assign it to your projects. You'll be able to edit your workflow inside the project, and it will not change the workflow template. You can use unlimited workflow steps (both in parallel or subsequently).

To create a workflow template in your Workspace, open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Workflow templates** on the left sidebar.

<Image src={createWorkflow} alt="Workflow" />

</ReadMore>

## Managing Language Requests

Project members can request new target languages for a project directly from project's **Dashboard** page by clicking **Request New Language**. As a project manager, you will receive these requests as notifications, which you can then review and add a new language if needed.

To manage these requests effectively, you first need to ensure your notifications are correctly configured.

### Enabling Notifications for Requests

To receive alerts when a user requests a language, you must have the appropriate notifications enabled in your **Account Settings**.

<Steps>
  1. Go to **Account Settings > Notifications**.
  2. Select **Language Requests** for your preferred notification channels (e.g., In-app, Email, Slack).
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  For timely reviews, consider enabling notifications for channels you check frequently, such as email or Slack.
</Aside>

### Reviewing a Language Request

Once a user requests a new language, you will be notified.

<Steps>
  1. Click the bell icon <Icon name="mdi:bell" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-right corner to see new notifications in a dropdown list.
  2. For a complete list of all notifications, click **Show all**. Alternatively, open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Notifications** on the left sidebar.
  3. On the **Notifications** page, find the request. The notification will show the project, the requested language, the user who sent the request, and any comments they provided.
  4. Click **Language Settings** to go directly to the projectâ€™s **Settings > Languages** page to add the requested language to the project.
</Steps>

## Generate Reports

Crowdin Enterprise provides project-level, group-level and organization-level reports to help you track progress, evaluate translation accuracy, estimate and count costs, and measure contributor activity. To access them, open the **Reports** section from the project, group, or organization view.

The reports available to you depend on your [manager role](/enterprise/roles/#manager):

* Project Managers â€“ can view reports for their assigned projects.
* Group Managers â€“ can view reports for projects and groups they manage.
* Workspace Managers â€“ can view reports across the organization, including project, group, and organization-level reports.

Available project-level reports include:

* Overview
* Cost Estimate
* Translation Cost
* Pre-translation Accuracy
* Translator Accuracy
* Top Members
* Archive

## Download Translations

You can download translations manually using the web interface (UI) or set up automated delivery using integrations (e.g., GitHub or other connected tools), the Crowdin Enterprise API, the console client (CLI), or Over-The-Air Content Delivery.

Translations are downloaded according to the export settings configured in the project's **Settings** section.

## Global Search

The Global Search feature enables you to locate content and resources across your entire organization efficiently. You can access Global Search from most pages in your Workspace, within projects (excluding the Editor), and other sections.

Search results are displayed based on the role of the user performing the search. For example, a translator will only see resources assigned to them, such as source strings or projects, while an organization admin can access all resources they have permissions for across the organization.

Recent search requests are stored so you can reuse or clear them as needed.

<Image src={globalSearch} alt="Global Search" />

### Using Global Search

To search for content and resources within your organization, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Click <Icon name="mdi:magnify" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-right corner of the Workspace or project page.
  2. Enter keywords or phrases in the search bar.
  3. You will be redirected to the Global Search results page automatically.
  4. Switch between the tabs to view results categorized by different content types.
  5. Click **Exit Search** to return to your Workspace.
