Crowdin Enterprise provides team cooperation features (e.g., inviting project members, defining permission levels, tasks, messages, etc.), workflow automation and customization, integrations and plugins, and many more features you would need for efficient project localization.

The migration to Crowdin Enterprise is very simple and straightforward. For example, if your projects share most of the settings and configurations, you can create and configure one project and then, using the [Project Duplicator](https://store.crowdin.com/create-project-app) application, create all other projects based on the initial project settings, later changing some settings where needed. Depending on the project and resource number, the complete migration could be done in several hours.

## Migrating to Crowdin Enterprise from Other Translation Tools

To start your migration, you can use the following step-by-step migration instructions.

<Steps>
  1. **Download source files**.<br/>
      In most cases, youâ€™ll have them on your machine/server, so this step is optional.

  2. **Download translations**.<br/>
      Download all the latest translations you have at the moment of transition.

  3. **Download TM and Glossary**.<br/>
      Download the translation memory and glossary so your translators can reuse them in your Crowdin Enterprise projects.
</Steps>

## Migrating to Crowdin Enterprise from Crowdin

If you're currently using Crowdin and would like to switch to Crowdin Enterprise, you can migrate your Crowdin projects with all related data and resources to your new Crowdin Enterprise organization using the **Migration to Crowdin Enterprise** tool in your Crowdin Account Settings.

You can migrate your Crowdin projects with all related data, TMs, and Glossaries to your Crowdin Enterprise organization and continue the localization process without losing the current progress.

<Aside title="Permissions">
  You can migrate projects from Crowdin to Crowdin Enterprise only if you are both a project owner in Crowdin and an organization owner in Crowdin Enterprise.
</Aside>

**Data you can migrate:**

* Projects with related data
* Source strings (for String-based projects) or source files (for File-based projects)
* Project members &ndash; this includes the removed former members who performed any translation or proofreading activities and pending members who haven't joined the projects. After migration, project members from both of these categories will appear as pending users in Crowdin Enterprise.
* Translations
* String comments
* Screenshots
* Labels
* Custom processors (if any)
* Translation Memories
* Glossaries

**Data not being migrated:**

* Over-The-Air (OTA) Content Delivery settings
* Project activities
* Master and Duplicate string statuses for projects with branches &ndash; master strings and duplicates are migrated without preserving the original (Crowdin) status of which string is the duplicate and which is the master. This might result in a situation where a duplicate string in Crowdin becomes a master string in Crowdin Enterprise and vice versa.
* Files from custom processing apps &ndash; these files either do not migrate or may migrate incorrectly.

### Migration Settings

Before starting the migration, you need to select your Crowdin Enterprise organization, projects, and resources.

To configure your migration settings, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open **Account Settings** and go to the **Profile** tab.
  2. In the **Migration to Crowdin Enterprise** section, click **Migrate Account** to start configuring your migration.
</Steps>

### Organization Step

On the first step of the migration, select a Crowdin Enterprise organization to which you will migrate your Crowdin account's data. You can log into your existing Crowdin Enterprise organization or create a new organization from scratch.

Once you've selected your Crowdin Enterprise organization, the system will ask you to authorize the **Migrate Crowdin account to Crowdin Enterprise** application and grant access to projects and groups within your organization. It's necessary because the migrator app will create your projects and resources in Crowdin Enterprise on your behalf.

<Image src={grantAccess} alt="Authorize the Application" class="width-2xl" />

### Projects Step

On the Projects step, you will see the list of your projects in Crowdin and your Crowdin Enterprise Workspace. Select the projects you'd like to migrate. By default, selected projects will be migrated to the organization's Workspace. If needed, you can create separate groups for different projects.

<Image src={selectProjects} alt="Select Projects for Migration" class="width-2xl" />

### Resources Step

On the Resources step, you will see the list of your Translation Memories and Glossaries. By default, resources related to the projects you selected in the previous step will be automatically selected. Select the additional ones you'd like to migrate. Then, click **Migrate** to start the migration process.

<Image src={selectResources} alt="Select Resources for Migration" class="width-2xl" />

### Migration Step

After you start the migration, you will be able to track its overall and detailed progress. Depending on the number of projects and resources, it might take from a few minutes to a few hours to migrate all the data. You will see the *Migration to Crowdin Enterprise is in progress* notification at the top of every page during the migration process. If needed, you can leave the **Account Settings** page. The migration will continue running in the background.

<Aside type="caution">
  The changes made on Crowdin after the migration started might not be migrated.

When the migration is finished, you can go to your Crowdin Enterprise organization and continue translating your projects.

## What Are the Next Steps?

<Steps>
  1. **Inviting the translation team**.<br/>
      In Crowdin Enterprise you can choose your translation strategy based on the content you're localizing. Choose one and combine several translation strategies: send a request to a translation vendor integrated with Crowdin Enterprise, bring a translation agency you already work with, invite your community, use pre-translation via Machine Translation or Translation Memory, etc.

  2. **Integration with external services**.<br/>
      In Crowdin Enterprise, you can use system integrations (e.g., integrations with GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, Azure Repos, etc.) to synchronize your source and translation files, install additional applications from the [Crowdin Store](https://store.crowdin.com/) to add new features and integrate with even more services. Even if there is no integration with some services/platforms you use, you can create your custom integration by developing Crowdin Apps.
