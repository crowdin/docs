## What is Crowdin Enterprise?

Crowdin Enterprise is a cloud-based solution for agile localization management. With Crowdin Enterprise, you can automate the updating of content for translation and finished translations, making it easy to create and maintain multilingual products. This includes mobile apps, cloud and desktop software, games, and all related content, such as help desks, websites, user guides, and automated emails.

Easily manage localization for multiple products involving needed people and resources. Gain more control, flexibility, and customization over localization in your company with the features and integrations Crowdin Enterprise offers.

## What is Agile Localization?

Agile localization is an approach that helps you deal with frequently updated content that you want to make available to your customers worldwide. Once you’ve decided to localize your product, it’s important to keep it that way and ensure the new content is also multilingual. This typically includes new features, product updates, documentation, websites, and other user-facing content.

While you’re creating new content, translators can work on translations, so you can get work done faster by working in parallel. The latest content can be available to translators nearly instantly and updated automatically. This way, they can start translating immediately in their own translation environment. At the same time, you can quickly receive finished translations via integrations and other automation tools.

This approach makes it easy to track which content has been updated, requires translation, or is ready for production. So when the new feature is ready for release, translations won’t slow you down, as they are done in parallel.

  <Card title="Organizations">
    An organization can be based on your company's domain, and it's a secure space that only invited people can access with specific permissions based on user roles. Each organization has its own workspace, user management, localization resources, organization settings, etc. As every organization has a workspace, all the projects are stored and easily managed from there.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Groups">
    Group managers and translation resources like Translation Memories, Glossaries, and Machine Translation engines by projects and project groups. Create several project groups and invite separate managers to each. Translation resources can be available organization-wide, to project groups, or to specific projects only.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Workflows">
    A workflow is a sequence of steps, such as translation or proofreading, that content in your project goes through. You can use unlimited workflow steps that can be connected both in parallel or subsequently. Customize your workflows and set up separate rules and permissions for each workflow step to automate the flow of content. Each step can have different target languages and assignees.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Vendor organizations">
    Any organization can invite another organization as a vendor. Translation by a vendor can be a part of your workflow, where the vendor organization receives limited access to your files and can help you with a specific part of your workflow, like translation or proofreading.
