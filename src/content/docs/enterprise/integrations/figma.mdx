With the Crowdin for Figma plugin, you can use texts from Crowdin Enterprise in your designs to save time for both designers and developers. These could include original or translated texts. If necessary, you can add new ones (e.g., dialog titles, button labels) and send them to translators in Crowdin Enterprise.

## Use Cases

* Quickly generate multilingual creative assets.
* Translate mockups and test them in different languages before the programming starts.
* Stop using 'Lorem Ipsum', add real texts from Crowdin Enterprise to your prototypes instead. Strings added from Crowdin Enterprise become linked to the text fields in Figma.
* Create and upload source strings from your designs to your Crowdin Enterprise project. Created strings become linked to text fields in Figma. This way, developers could use uploaded strings, reducing time spent on development.
* Preview translations and string keys in your designs.
* Upload tagged screenshots to your Crowdin Enterprise project.

## Installation

<Steps>
  1. Sign in to Figma.
  2. Open one of your design files or click **New design file**.

</CardGrid>

## UI Localization

Use the **Strings** tab when localizing UI and working on dynamic pages with your development and marketing teams. In this tab, you can add source strings from Crowdin Enterprise to your designs in Figma in a click. After the texts are used in the designs, you can automatically upload tagged screenshots for translators' reference back to Crowdin Enterprise.

### Using Source Strings from Crowdin in Figma

<Steps>
  1. Open the Crowdin plugin for Figma.
  2. In the **Strings** tab, use the **Search** field to find the specific copy. You can search strings by source text, string identifier, or context. <Image src={stringsTab} alt="Figma Plugin Strings Tab" class="width-xl" />
  3. Select the text layer in Figma to which you want to add text and click the link icon next to the needed string in the plugin.
</Steps>

After using the source strings from Crowdin Enterprise in your designs, they become linked with the text fields, and you can [preview translations](#previewing-strings) for these strings in Figma and [upload screenshots](#uploading-tagged-screenshots-to-crowdin) for them to your Crowdin Enterprise project.

You can link a single Crowdin Enterprise string to one or multiple text fields in Figma. However, one text field can be linked only to a single Crowdin Enterprise string. If you link a text field with an existing connection to a new Crowdin Enterprise string, the previous connection will be terminated, and a new connection will be established. To unlink a Crowdin Enterprise string from all text fields it was previously linked to, right-click on the link icon next to the needed string.

### Managing Linked Strings

You can edit a string's text, context, or other properties directly within the plugin. To do so, click the <Icon name="mdi:pencil" class="inline-icon" /> icon next to it in the string list. Make your desired changes in the edit form and click **Save**.

From the same list, you can also hide or delete strings using their respective icons. Any changes you make will be synchronized with your Crowdin project.

<Aside type="tip" title="Find All Linked Elements Instantly">
  When you click to edit a string that is linked to one or more text elements in your design, the plugin will automatically select and highlight all of those text elements on your Figma canvas. This helps you instantly see every location where a particular string is being used.
</Aside>

### Adding Source Strings from Figma to Crowdin

You can add strings that are already used in the designs.

<Steps>
  1. Open the Crowdin plugin for Figma.
  2. To add the strings used in the designs, select the whole frame, multiple frames, or the needed text elements on the frames.
  3. In the **Strings** tab, click <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" />.
  4. In the appeared dialog, review the list of strings to be added. If needed, click the filter icon <Icon name="mdi:filter-variant" class="inline-icon" /> to open the filter panel and exclude certain elements:
      * Select the **Skip hidden elements** if some frames contain hidden elements that should not be added to Crowdin Enterprise.
      * Select the **Skip untranslatable elements** if some frames contain untranslatable elements that should not be added to Crowdin Enterprise.
      * Select the **Skip locked elements** to exclude any locked text elements from being sent for translation. This is useful when you want certain text to remain visible on screenshots for context but not be added to Crowdin Enterprise as a source string. <Image src={addStrings} alt="Figma Plugin Add String" class="width-2xl" />
  5. *(Optional)* To update the string context and set the max.length of the translated text, click <Icon name="mdi:cog-outline" class="inline-icon" /> next to the needed string.
  6. Once all the needed strings are selected and configured, click **Next**.
  7. In the next dialog page, select the preferred options:
      * **Auto-link existing strings** &ndash; Automatically compare text to existing strings in Crowdin Enterprise. If there's a match, the text element will be linked to the string in the Crowdin Enterprise project.
      * **Create missing keys** &ndash; Only new text elements are added to Crowdin Enterprise.
      * **Merge duplicates** &ndash; Link identical text elements to a single new string in Crowdin Enterprise. The default behavior is to identify duplicates by comparing their source text. This is useful in the following cases:
         * When adding multiple text fields with the same text (e.g., several buttons with the label `Submit`), the plugin adds only one string to your Crowdin Enterprise project and links all duplicate text fields to it.
         * If your Crowdin Enterprise project already contains a string with the same text you're adding from designs, the plugin links to the existing string instead of creating a new one.
         * To change the duplicate detection method, enable the **Detect duplicates by key** sub-option. This will make the plugin identify duplicates by their string identifiers (keys) rather than their text content.
      * *(Optional)* To add labels to the strings, alternately select them from the **Labels** drop-down menu.
      * [**Send screenshots**](#uploading-tagged-screenshots-to-crowdin).
  8. From the **File** drop-down menu, select the file in Crowdin Enterprise to which you want to add the strings.
  9. Click **Submit**.
</Steps>

#### Understanding the Upload Summary

Once the strings are added to Crowdin Enterprise, you'll see a summary of the content sent. This summary provides detailed feedback on the operation:

* **Keys created**: The number of new strings added to your Crowdin Enterprise project.
* **Keys updated**: The number of existing strings in Crowdin Enterprise that were updated.
* **Keys linked**: The number of existing strings in Crowdin Enterprise that were linked to text elements in Figma.
* **Text elements linked**: The total number of text elements in Figma that were linked to strings in Crowdin Enterprise. This number can be higher than **Keys linked** if multiple text elements were linked to a single string.
* **Screenshots created**: The number of new screenshots uploaded to Crowdin Enterprise.
* **Screenshots updated**: The number of existing screenshots that were updated.

From the summary screen, you can click **Open in Crowdin** to view the strings in your project or click **Main page** to return to the plugin's main screen.

### Adding Source Strings with Plural Forms

You can add strings with plural forms.

<Steps>
  1. Open the Crowdin plugin for Figma.
  2. To add the strings used in the designs, select the whole frame, multiple frames, or the needed text elements on the frames.
  3. In the **Strings** tab, click <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" />.
  4. In the appeared dialog, review the list of strings.
  5. Click <Icon name="mdi:cog-outline" class="inline-icon" /> next to the needed string and click **Add plurals**.
  6. In the appeared dialog, fill in the fields for each plural form and click **Save**. Depending on the source language of the connected Crowdin Enterprise project, there could be a different number of plural forms you should specify.
  7. Once all the needed strings are selected and configured, click **Next**.
  8. Select the preferred options and the file in Crowdin Enterprise you want to add the strings to, then click **Submit**.
</Steps>

<Aside>
  When adding plural strings, the fields in the **String** column serve for adding the **other** plural form. You can add plural strings only to files that support plural forms (e.g., Android XML, Stringsdict, XLIFF, etc.).

### Configuring ICU Source String Placeholders

When using ICU strings in your design, you can set the placeholders' values, and after adding such strings to designs, they will be displayed in a formatted view with the preconfigured values.

Once you [use](#using-source-strings-from-crowdin-in-figma) the needed ICU string from Crowdin Enterprise in your design, you can configure its placeholder values.

<Steps>
  1. Open the Crowdin plugin for Figma.
  2. In the **Strings** tab, use the **Search** field to find the specific copy by source text, string identifier, or context.
  3. Click <Icon name="mdi:pencil" class="inline-icon" /> on the needed ICU string.
  4. Click **Set placeholders**.
  5. Type the needed values for ICU string placeholders.
  6. Click **Save** to save the entered placeholders.
  7. Click **Save** to update the source string text in designs.
</Steps>

When [previewing translations](#previewing-strings) for ICU strings in Figma, they will also be displayed in a formatted view if the values were preconfigured beforehand.

### Key Naming Pattern Settings

To simplify adding strings from Figma to the Crowdin Enterprise project, you can set up the desired key naming pattern for the source string identifiers in the plugin settings. The Crowdin plugin for Figma will suggest the string identifiers for new strings based on the selected pattern. While adding new source strings, you can always edit the suggested identifier to the preferred look.

To select the key naming pattern, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open the Crowdin plugin for Figma.
  2. Switch to the **Settings** tab.
  3. In the **Key Naming Pattern** section, select the preferred option from the drop-down menu.
</Steps>

Besides the existing patterns, you can configure your own pattern. To use a custom pattern, select the **Custom key naming pattern** option from the drop-down list and specify your pattern in the **Custom Key Naming Pattern** field.

### Uploading Tagged Screenshots to Crowdin

When [adding source strings used in the designs](#adding-source-strings-from-figma-to-crowdin), make sure to keep **Send screenshots** selected. As a result, the Crowdin plugin for Figma will upload screenshots along with the source strings.

Also, you can update screenshots with an **Update screenshots** option while editing a Crowdin Enterprise string that is linked to the text fields in designs.

Additionally, you can mass upload screenshots to Crowdin Enterprise for strings linked with text fields in designs.

<Steps>
  1. Open the Crowdin plugin for Figma.
  2. Select one or more frames with the linked strings.
  3. In the **Strings** tab, click **Send tagged screenshots to Crowdin**<Icon name="mdi:image-outline" class="inline-icon" /> to upload screenshots for selected frames.
</Steps>

### Previewing Strings

Preview translations from Crowdin Enterprise for the strings used in the designs directly in Figma. By default, previews are generated on a new, duplicated page to keep your original designs intact.

<Image src={previewStrings} alt="Figma Plugin Preview Strings" class="width-xl" />

#### Previewing Translations

To preview strings populated with translations, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open the Crowdin plugin for Figma.
  2. Go to the **Strings** tab and expand the **Preview Strings from Crowdin** section.
  3. Ensure the **Preview in duplicated page** checkbox is selected.
  4. Select **Create with language**.
  5. Select the target language you want to preview translations for (optionally, you can select the preferred plural forms). You can also choose **All languages**.
  6. Choose the content you want to preview in Figma: **All Frames** or **Selected Frames**.
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  To preview translations directly on your current page, clear the **Preview in duplicated page** checkbox. Note that doing so will disable other options, such as creating previews with key names.
</Aside>

#### Previewing with Key Names

To help developers identify strings, you can populate your designs with string keys instead of translated text.

<Steps>
  1. Open the Crowdin plugin for Figma.
  2. Go to the **Strings** tab and expand the **Preview Strings from Crowdin** section.
  3. Ensure the **Preview in duplicated page** checkbox is selected.
  4. Select **Create with key names**.
  5. Choose the content you want to preview in Figma: **All Frames** or **Selected Frames**.
</Steps>

### Filtering Strings

You can filter strings in the **Strings** tab by various criteria, such as file or link status. Click <Icon name="mdi:filter-variant" class="inline-icon" /> to open the filter side panel. Here, you can select files to view strings from or show only strings linked to your current text selection (e.g., selected text elements, an entire frame, or multiple frames). Click **Reset** to clear all filter options.

## Marketing Visuals Localization

Use the **Pages** tab to localize static pages, like brochures and banners. In this tab, you can send texts with context for translators to Crowdin Enterprise and upload translated copies back to Figma.

<Image src={pagesTab} alt="Figma Plugin Pages Tab" class="width-xl" />

<Aside type="caution" title="Limitations">
  The Pages tab and some other plugin settings may be unavailable when working with [string-based](/enterprise/creating-project/#string-based-project) projects.
</Aside>

### Sending Texts for Translation to Crowdin

You can send text for translation either from selected or all frames from a Figma file. Translators will work with those texts in the list view and use designs as an additional context for even higher translation quality.

In Crowdin Enterprise, a root folder *figma-plugin* will be created. It will contain a subfolder named after your Figma file with HTML files for each frame inside. If needed, you can disable content segmentation in the plugin **Settings** so the long texts will not be split into sentences.

To send Figma designs for translation, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open the necessary Figma file.
  2. Go to **Plugins > Crowdin for Figma**.
  3. In the **Pages** > **Figma to Crowdin** section, select the content you want to translate: **All Frames** or **Selected Frames**.
</Steps>

When the source files are uploaded to your Crowdin Enterprise project, you can invite contributors to translate and proofread them.

<ReadMore>
  Read more about [translation strategies](/enterprise/translation-strategies/).
</ReadMore>

### Uploading Translations from Crowdin to Figma

You can synchronize texts between Figma and Crowdin Enterprise projects whenever you want to test the translated copy inside Figma or generate multilingual assets.

To upload translated copies to Figma, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open the necessary Figma file.
  2. Go to **Plugins > Crowdin for Figma**.
  3. In the **Pages** tab, **Crowdin to Figma** section, select the target language you want to upload translations for. You can also select **All languages**.
  4. Select the content you want to apply translations to: **All Frames** or **Selected Frames**.
</Steps>

After uploading translations to Figma, the modified file will contain a separate frame with translations for each target language. The newly uploaded translated versions won’t override the ones you uploaded previously. You can always delete the translated copies you no longer need.

If you'd like the newly uploaded translated versions to override the previously uploaded ones, open the plugin **Settings** and select **Override existing translations**.

### Using the Plugin with Figma Buzz :badge[New]{variant=success}

The Crowdin for Figma plugin is fully compatible with [Figma's Buzz editor](https://www.figma.com/buzz/), a new space designed for creating marketing and advertising content. This integration is ideal for teams localizing social media assets, digital ads, and other promotional visuals.

When using the plugin in Buzz, you'll find a streamlined version of the **Pages** tab directly in the left sidebar. The workflow is optimized for the Buzz editor:

* **Focused Functionality:** Only the **Pages** tab is available, giving you direct access to the features you need for visual localization.
* **Asset-Based Selection:** Instead of selecting frames, you'll work with assets. The buttons are labeled **Selected Assets** to match the Buzz terminology.

To localize your designs in Figma Buzz, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open the Crowdin plugin from the left sidebar.
  2. In the Buzz editor, select one or more assets you wish to translate.
  3. In the **Figma to Crowdin** section, click **Selected Assets** to send your content for translation.
  4. Once translations are ready, select the target language from the **Crowdin to Figma** section and click **Selected Assets** again to apply the translations.
</Steps>

## Pseudo-localization

Even before translations are completed, you can test whether your application is ready to be localized using pseudo-localization. This feature allows you to simulate how the application's UI will look with different languages to check whether the source strings should be modified before the project localization starts.

Depending on the content you want to test, you can use the **Strings** or **Pages** tab in the Crowdin for Figma plugin.

<Tabs syncKey="figmaMode">
  <TabItem label="Strings tab">
    <Steps>
      1. Open the necessary Figma file.

</ReadMore>

The integration of Crowdin for Figma plugin with Dev Mode extends the functionality of both platforms, enhancing the localization process within the design environment. While Dev Mode in Figma is read-only, certain limitations apply to the Crowdin for Figma plugin's capabilities:

**What You Can Do**:

* Access the **Strings** tab to view and manage strings.
* Explore string details, including file, key, context, and labels.
* Quickly copy string keys for efficient workflow.

Features not available in Dev Mode: adding new strings to Crowdin Enterprise, linking strings, sending screenshots, previewing translations, editing, hiding, or deleting strings.

### Using Crowdin for Figma Plugin in Dev Mode

Despite the limitations, the Crowdin for Figma plugin remains valuable in Dev Mode, offering developers a streamlined approach to text elements management. Here's a typical use case:

<Steps>
  1. Enter [Dev Mode](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/15023124644247-Guide-to-Dev-Mode#01H8CR3K6VG21T3H9789QMV6CP).
  2. In the right sidebar, switch to the *Plugins* tab.
  3. Click on **Crowdin for Figma**.
  4. In the **Strings** tab, click **Filter strings**<Icon name="mdi:filter-variant" class="inline-icon" /> and select **Show strings linked to selected text elements**.
  5. Select the needed text element on the frame and hover over the <Icon name="mdi:info-outline" class="inline-icon" /> icon in the string list to view all needed information (i.e., key, context, file it's stored in, labels) about this particular string.
  6. *(Optional)* Click **Copy string key to clipboard** to further use it in code.
</Steps>

### Compatibility with Figma for VS Code

## Troubleshooting

### Screenshot Generation Issues in Large Figma Files

When uploading strings with screenshots from large Figma files, users may experience slow performance or Figma freezing. This issue occurs when text elements are placed within a large top-level frame.

When you add a string from Figma to Crowdin Enterprise, the plugin:

1. Identifies the top-level frame containing the text element.
2. Converts this frame into an image using the Figma API.
3. Uploads the image to Crowdin Enterprise as a screenshot.

The plugin always searches for the highest-level frame in the hierarchy and stops when encountering a non-frame element (such as a section or group). If the top-level frame is too large, generating a screenshot can cause performance issues.

For example:

- `section` > `group` > **`frame`** > `text` → The plugin captures the screenshot from `frame`.
- **`frame 1`** > `frame 2` > `frame 3` > `text` → The plugin captures the screenshot from `frame 1`.

To prevent slowdowns, restructure your Figma file so that top-level frames contain only the relevant UI context. Instead of placing all UI elements in a single large frame, break them into smaller, logical sections.

### Font Replacement When Linking Strings

When working in Figma, fonts that are missing locally may cause unexpected changes after linking strings using the Crowdin for Figma plugin.

This situation typically happens when:

* The original design uses a font that is not installed in your local Figma environment.
* Figma marks missing fonts with a special **A?** icon shown in the upper-left corner of the canvas and next to the font name in the **Typography** section of the right sidebar.
* When you select a text element with a missing font, Figma displays a **Missing font** dialog offering to replace it.

If you link a Crowdin string to such a text element, Figma will automatically substitute the missing font with a default available font (e.g., Roboto). This is expected behavior. The plugin attempts to preserve the original font, but when it’s not available in your local system, Figma replaces it to ensure the text remains visible and editable.

This issue may not be immediately noticeable. Some users detect the font change only after uploading screenshots from Figma to Crowdin Enterprise, which can cause confusion.

To avoid this:

* Check for missing font indicators (**A?**) before linking strings.
* Make sure the fonts used in the original design are installed and available in your Figma.
* If necessary, coordinate with the designer to confirm the correct font setup.

### Mixed Fonts Within Text Nodes

The Crowdin for Figma plugin does not support mixed fonts within a single text node due to technical limitations. This includes different font configurations, such as different font weights (e.g., 400 vs 700), even when using the same font family.

When you download translations to such text nodes, the plugin will apply the first font configuration used in the string to the entire text.

To avoid this issue:

* Ensure each text node uses a single font with a shared configuration for the entire text.
* Use regular formatting styles (bold, italic, etc.) instead of different font configurations to achieve visual emphasis.
