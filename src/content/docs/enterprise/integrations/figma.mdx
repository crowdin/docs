With the Crowdin for Figma plugin, you can use texts from Crowdin Enterprise in your designs to save time for both designers and developers. These could include original or translated texts. If necessary, you can add new ones (e.g., dialog titles, button labels) and send them to translators in Crowdin Enterprise.

## Use Cases

* Quickly generate multilingual creative assets.
* Translate mockups and test them in different languages before the programming starts.
* Stop using 'Lorem Ipsum', add real texts from Crowdin Enterprise to your prototypes instead. Strings added from Crowdin Enterprise become linked to the text fields in Figma.
* Create and upload source strings from your designs to your Crowdin Enterprise project. Created strings become linked to text fields in Figma. This way, developers could use uploaded strings, reducing time spent on development.
* Preview translations and string keys in your designs.
* Upload tagged screenshots to your Crowdin Enterprise project.

</CardGrid>

## UI Localization

Use the *Strings* tab when localizing UI and working on dynamic pages with your development and marketing teams. In this tab, you can add source strings from Crowdin Enterprise to your designs in Figma in a click. After the texts are used in the designs, you can automatically upload tagged screenshots for translators' reference back to Crowdin Enterprise.

### Using Source Strings from Crowdin in Figma

<Steps>
  1. Open the Crowdin plugin for Figma.
  2. In the *Strings* tab, use the *Search* field to find the specific copy. You can search strings by source text, string identifier, or context. <Image src={stringsTab} alt="Figma Plugin Strings Tab" />
  3. Select the text layer to which you want to add text and click the link icon next to the needed string. <img src={stringsTabUseStrings.src} alt="Figma Plugin Using Source Strings from Crowdin in Figma" />
</Steps>

After using the source strings from Crowdin Enterprise in your designs, they become linked with the text fields, and you can [preview translations](#previewing-strings) for these strings in Figma and [upload screenshots](#uploading-tagged-screenshots-to-crowdin) for them to your Crowdin Enterprise project.

You can link a single Crowdin Enterprise string to one or multiple text fields in Figma. However, one text field can be linked only to a single Crowdin Enterprise string. If you link a text field with an existing connection to a new Crowdin Enterprise string, the previous connection will be terminated, and a new connection will be established. If you'd like to unlink a Crowdin Enterprise string from all text fields it was previously linked to, right-click on the link icon next to the needed string.

### Adding Source Strings from Figma to Crowdin

You can add strings that are already used in the designs.

<Steps>
  1. Open the Crowdin plugin for Figma.
  2. To add the strings used in the designs, select the whole frame, multiple frames, or the needed strings on the frames.
  3. In the *Strings* tab, click <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" />.
  4. In the appeared dialog, fill in the required fields. You can filter the displayed strings if needed:
      * Select the **Skip hidden elements** filter option if some frames contain hidden elements that should not be added to Crowdin Enterprise.
      * Select the **Skip untranslated elements** filter option if some frames contain untranslated elements that should not be added to Crowdin Enterprise. <Image src={addStrings} alt="Figma Plugin Add String" />
  5. *(Optional)* To update the string context and set the max.length of the translated text, click <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon" /> toward the needed string.
  6. Once all the needed strings are selected and configured, click **Next**.
  7. In the next dialog page, select the preferred options:
      * Auto-link existing strings &ndash; automatically compare text to existing strings in Crowdin Enterprise. If there's a match, the text element will be linked to the string in the Crowdin Enterprise project.
      * Create missing keys &ndash; only new text elements are added to Crowdin Enterprise.
      * *(Optional)* To add labels to the strings, alternately select them from the **Select Label** drop-down menu.
      * Merge duplicates &ndash; link identical text elements to a single new string in Crowdin Enterprise. It's useful in the following cases:
      * When adding multiple text fields with the same text, the plugin will add only one string to your Crowdin Enterprise project and link all duplicate text fields to it.
      * If your Crowdin Enterprise project already contains a string with the same text you're adding from designs, the plugin will only link the text fields to the existing string and won't create a new one.
      * [Send screenshots](#uploading-tagged-screenshots-to-crowdin).
  8. Select the file in Crowdin Enterprise to which you want to add the strings. To add the same strings into multiple files in Crowdin Enterprise, alternately select the needed files from the **Select File** drop-down menu.
  9. Click **Submit**.
  10. Once the strings are added to Crowdin Enterprise, you'll see a summary of the content sent.
</Steps>

Added strings will be transferred to your Crowdin Enterprise project and also displayed in the **Strings** tab's list. You can edit, hide, or delete the strings from the same list anytime. The respective changes will also be applied to the strings in your Crowdin Enterprise project.

### Adding Source Strings with Plural Forms

You can add strings with plural forms.

<Steps>
  1. Open the Crowdin plugin for Figma.
  2. To add the strings used in the designs, select the whole frame, multiple frames, or the needed strings on the frames.
  3. In the *Strings* tab, click <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" />.
  4. In the appeared dialog, fill in the required fields. You can filter the displayed strings if needed.
  5. Click <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon" /> toward the needed string and click **Add plurals**.
  6. In the appeared dialog, fill in the fields for each plural form and click **Save**. Depending on the source language of the connected Crowdin Enterprise project, there could be a different number of plural forms you should specify.
  7. Once all the needed strings are selected and configured, click **Next**.
  8. Select the preferred options and the file in Crowdin Enterprise you want to add the strings to, click **Submit**.
</Steps>

<Aside>
  When adding plural strings, the fields in the **String** column serve for adding the **other** plural form. You can add plural strings only to files that support plural forms (e.g., Android XML, Stringsdict, XLIFF, etc.).

<Steps>
  1. Select the needed text fields.
  2. In the *Strings* tab, click **Filter strings**.
  3. Select **Show strings linked to selected text elements**.
</Steps>

In the same way, you can filter strings linked to text fields for the whole frame or multiple frames.

## Marketing Visuals Localization

Use the *Pages* tab to localize static pages, like brochures and banners. In this tab, you can send texts with context for translators to Crowdin Enterprise and upload translated copies back to Figma.

<Aside type="caution" title="Limitations">
  The Pages tab and some other plugin settings may be unavailable when working with [string-based](/enterprise/creating-project/#string-based-project) projects.
</Aside>

### Sending Texts for Translation to Crowdin

You can send text for translation either from selected or all frames from a Figma file. Translators will work with those texts in the list view and use designs as an additional context for even higher translation quality.

In Crowdin Enterprise, a root folder *figma-plugin* will be created. It will contain a subfolder named after your Figma file with HTML files for each frame inside. If needed, you can disable content segmentation in the plugin **Settings** so the long texts will not be split into sentences.

To send Figma designs for translation, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open the necessary Figma file.
  2. Go to **Plugins > Crowdin for Figma**.
  3. In the *Pages* > *Figma to Crowdin* section, select the content youâ€™d like to translate. Select *All Frames* or *Selected Frames*.
</Steps>

<Image src={send} alt="Figma Plugin Send Texts" />

When the source files are uploaded to your Crowdin Enterprise project, you can invite contributors to translate and proofread them.

### Uploading Translations from Crowdin to Figma

You can synchronize texts between Figma and Crowdin Enterprise project whenever you want to test the translated copy inside Figma or generate multilingual assets.

To upload translated copies to Figma, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open the necessary Figma file.
  2. Go to **Plugins > Crowdin for Figma**.
  3. In the *Pages* tab, *Crowdin to Figma* section, select the target language you want to upload translations for. You can also select *All languages*.
  4. Select the content you want to preview in Figma. Select *All Frames* or *Selected Frames*.
</Steps>

<Image src={uploadTranslations} alt="Figma Plugin Upload Translations" />

After uploading translations to Figma, the modified file will contain a separate frame with translations for each target language. The newly uploaded translated versions wonâ€™t override the ones you uploaded previously. You can always delete the translated copies you no longer need.

If you'd like the newly uploaded translated versions to override the previously uploaded ones, open the plugin **Settings** and select **Override existing translations**.

## Pseudo-localization

Even before translations are completed, you can test whether your application is ready to be localized using pseudo-localization. This feature allows you to simulate how the application's UI will look with different languages to check whether the source strings should be modified before the project localization starts.

Depending on the content you want to test, you can use the *Strings* or *Pages* tab in the Crowdin for Figma plugin.

<Tabs syncKey="figmaMode">
  <TabItem label="Strings tab">
    <Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Screenshot Generation Issues in Large Figma Files

When uploading strings with screenshots from large Figma files, users may experience slow performance or Figma freezing. This issue occurs when text elements are placed within a large top-level frame.

When you add a string from Figma to Crowdin Enterprise, the plugin:

1. Identifies the top-level frame containing the text element.
2. Converts this frame into an image using the Figma API.
3. Uploads the image to Crowdin Enterprise as a screenshot.

The plugin always searches for the highest-level frame in the hierarchy and stops when encountering a non-frame element (such as a section or group). If the top-level frame is too large, generating a screenshot can cause performance issues.

For example:

- `section` > `group` > **`frame`** > `text` â†’ The plugin captures the screenshot from `frame`.
- **`frame 1`** > `frame 2` > `frame 3` > `text` â†’ The plugin captures the screenshot from `frame 1`.

To prevent slowdowns, restructure your Figma file so that top-level frames contain only the relevant UI context. Instead of placing all UI elements in a single large frame, break them into smaller, logical sections.
