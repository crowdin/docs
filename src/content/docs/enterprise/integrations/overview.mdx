## VCS Integrations

The key challenge engineers face is the lack of automation. Source content needs to be constantly extracted from the codebase and handed over to the translation team. Completed translations should then be integrated back into the codebase. Without an automated approach, this workflow becomes a repetitive and time-consuming exchange of files.

With the automation provided by VCS Integrations, source strings are pulled automatically, ensuring they are always up-to-date for your translators. Completed translations are then pushed back to your repository as a request.

## Design

Quickly generate language-specific assets. Send content for translation with context for translators, while you're working on the mock-ups or polishing prototypes.

## Starred Apps

You can star an app by clicking the <Icon name="mdi:star-outline" class="inline-icon" /> icon next to its name, either from the app list or within the app itself, allowing you to mark apps for quick access. This feature is available for integrations and tools (excluding service-related items like Webhooks, Service Logs, etc.) and is accessible to project members with the Developer role or higher.

Once you star an app, it gets pinned to the top of the relevant sections, such as **Integrations** or **Tools**. Additionally, a new button will appear in the project **Dashboard**, providing quick access to all your starred apps. The app list will also automatically sort by starred items when you add a new favorite.

Starring works on an individual account basis, meaning each project member will see their own starred apps in the **Integrations**, **Tools**, and project **Dashboard** sections, independent of other members' selections.

## Co-managing Crowdin Apps

Multiple managers and developers can collaboratively manage the same Crowdin App within a project, simplifying teamwork and ensuring shared control over integrations. When an app is first configured in a project, the initial manager who logs in becomes its primary manager, with exclusive rights to log out from the app. All invited managers and developers share common app settings—meaning changes made by one manager are immediately visible to others.

This approach facilitates efficient team collaboration, avoids duplication of efforts, and ensures consistent configuration across your localization workflow.

### Inviting Another User to Manage an App

To invite additional managers or developers to co-manage an app, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open the app in your Crowdin project.
  2. Click **Share** within the app interface.
  3. Select existing project or organization members from the user list or enter the invitee's email to invite them as a new project manager. You can invite users with the following roles:
      * Owner
      * Admins
      * Managers
      * Developers
  4. Click **Save** to send the invitation.
</Steps>

Once invited, users will gain full access to manage and configure the app (except logging out).

### Requesting Access to Manage an App

If you open an app that has already been configured by another manager, you’ll see a message indicating that you don’t have access. The message also displays the name of the manager currently managing the app.

To request access, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Click the primary manager’s name in the message.
  2. You’ll be redirected to a private conversation with the manager in Crowdin.
  3. Send a message requesting access to co-manage the app.
  4. The primary manager can open the app, click **Share**, and invite you from the user list.
</Steps>

As soon as you are invited, you’ll immediately gain access to manage and configure the app (except logging out).

### Permissions and App Management Roles

All managers co-managing an app have identical permissions within it, except only the primary manager—the first to configure the app—can log out from the app.

Managers can also invite Developers, who will gain similar permissions but cannot further invite other users to manage the app. Admin and Owner roles can also be invited with full permissions.

  Communication and clearly defining responsibilities among app managers can help maintain configuration consistency and avoid unintended setting changes.
