## VCS Integrations

Lack of automation is the key challenge engineers face. Source content should be constantly extracted from the code base and handed to the translation team, and ready translations should be integrated back. Without an automated approach, this workflow turns into a constant and irritating file sending back and forth.

Source strings are pulled automatically and are always up-to-date for your translators. Translated content is automatically pushed to your repository as a request.

## Design

Quickly generate language-specific assets. Send content for translation with context for translators, while you're working on the mock-ups or polishing prototypes.
