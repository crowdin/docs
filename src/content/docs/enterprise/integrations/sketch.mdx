With the Crowdin plugin for Sketch, you can use texts from Crowdin Enterprise in your designs to save time for both designers and developers. These could include original or translated texts. If necessary, you can add new ones (e.g., dialog titles, button labels) and send them to translators in Crowdin Enterprise.

## Use Cases

* Quickly generate multilingual creative assets.
* Translate mockups and test them in different languages before the programming starts.
* Stop using 'Lorem Ipsum', add real texts from Crowdin Enterprise to your prototypes instead.
* Create and upload source strings from your designs to your Crowdin Enterprise project. This way, uploaded strings could be used by developers, which reduces time spent on development.
* Upload tagged screenshots to your Crowdin Enterprise project.

## Installation

You can [download the latest release](https://github.com/crowdin/sketch-crowdin) from our GitHub repository.

<Steps>
  1. Download the installation file.

Added strings will be transferred to your Crowdin Enterprise project and also will be displayed in the list of the **Strings** tab. You can edit or delete the strings from the same list anytime. The respective changes will also be applied to the strings in your Crowdin Enterprise project.

### Key Naming Pattern Settings

To simplify adding strings from Sketch to the Crowdin Enterprise project, you can set up the desired key naming pattern for the source string identifiers in the plugin settings.

## Marketing Visuals Localization

Use the *Translation* tab to localize static pages, like brochures and banners. In this tab, you can send texts with context for translators to Crowdin Enterprise and upload translated copies back to Sketch.

### Sending Texts for Translation to Crowdin

You can send text for translation either from selected or all artboards from a Sketch file. Translators will work with those texts in the list view and use designs as an additional context for even higher translation quality.

In Crowdin Enterprise, a root folder *Sketch plugin* will be created. It will contain a subfolder named after your Sketch file with HTML files for each artboard inside. If needed, you can disable content segmentation in the plugin **Settings** so the long texts will not be split into sentences.

To send Sketch designs for translation, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open the necessary Sketch file.
  2. Go to **Plugins > Crowdin**.
  3. In the *Translation* tab, *Send Texts* section, select content youâ€™d like to translate. Select *Page* or *Artboard*.
</Steps>

<Image src={translationTabSendTexts} alt="Sketch Plugin Send Texts for Translation to Crowdin" />

When the source files are uploaded to your Crowdin Enterprise project, you can invite contributors to translate and proofread them.

### Uploading Translations from Crowdin to Sketch

You can synchronize texts between Sketch and Crowdin Enterprise projects whenever you want to test the translated copy inside Sketch or generate multilingual assets.

To upload translated copies to Sketch, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open the necessary Sketch file.
  2. Go to **Plugins > Crowdin**.
  3. In the *Translation* tab, *Get Translations* section, select the target language you want to upload translations for. You can also Select *All languages*.
  4. Select the content you want to preview in Sketch. Select *Page* or *Artboard*.
</Steps>

<Image src={translationTabGetTranslations} alt="Sketch Plugin Get Translations" />

After uploading translations to Sketch, the modified file will contain a separate artboard with translations for each target language. The newly uploaded translated versions wonâ€™t override the ones you uploaded previously. You can always delete the translated copies you no longer need.

If you'd like the newly uploaded translated versions to override the previously uploaded ones, open the plugin **Settings** and select **Override existing translations**.
