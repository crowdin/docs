A vendor is an external organization that provides professional translation services. In Crowdin Enterprise, you can cooperate with vendors in two ways:

* Add a vendor's manager to your organization &ndash; recommended if you work with a single translation agency. After joining your organization, the vendor’s manager can manage the entire localization process for you, including assigning translators, managing context, and generating reports.
* Invite an existing organization to be your vendor &ndash; a good option if you plan to work with multiple translation agencies. Once connected, you can assign vendors to specific workflow steps in your projects.

## Inviting an Existing Organization to Be a Vendor

When you assign a workflow step to a vendor, the vendor organization receives a copy of the step in their **Incoming Projects** section. After accepting the invitation, they can configure their own workflows and invite contributors as needed.

To invite a vendor organization, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Vendors** on the left sidebar.
  1. Click **Invite vendor** in the center of the page.
  1. In the **Invite vendor** dialog, enter the subdomain of the existing Crowdin Enterprise organization.
  1. *(Optional)* Add a message to provide additional context.
  1. Click **Invite**. <Image src={inviteForm} alt="Vendor invite form" class="width-xl" />
  1. Alternatively, click **Get a shareable link** and send it to the vendor manually.
