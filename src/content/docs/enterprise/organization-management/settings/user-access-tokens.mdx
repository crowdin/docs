As an organization owner or admin, you can view and manage all personal access tokens (PATs) created by your organization's members from a single, centralized page. This allows you to monitor API usage and enhance security by revoking tokens when necessary.

To manage access tokens of your organization, go to **Organization Settings > User access tokens**.

## Managing User Access Tokens

The **User access tokens** page displays a list of all active personal access tokens within your organization.

<Image src={userAccessTokens} alt="User Access Tokens page" />

The table provides the following information for each token:

* **Name**: The descriptive name given to the token upon creation.
* **Token**: A partially masked version of the token for identification.
* **Created By**: The organization member who generated the token.
* **Created**: The date the token was created.
* **Last used**: The date the token was last used to make an API request.
* **Expires**: The token's expiration date. A value of "never" indicates the token does not expire.

### Revoking a User Access Token

You can revoke any member's personal access token at any time. This is useful if a token is compromised, associated with a former employee, or no longer needed.

To revoke a token, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Go to **Organization Settings > User access tokens**.
  2. Find the token you wish to revoke in the list and click **Revoke** next to it.
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution" title="Revocation is Immediate">
  Revoking a token is a permanent action. Once revoked, the token can no longer be used to access the API, which may break any applications or scripts that rely on it.
