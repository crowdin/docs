Custom Placeholders are designed for cases when the source texts contain some less common placeholders that are not highlighted in the source strings (in the Editor) by default.

## Configure your Custom Placeholders

You can manage Custom Placeholders in the **Organization Settings**.

<Steps>
  1. Click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner and select **Organization Settings**. <Image src={organizationSettingsMenuItem} alt="Organization Settings" />
  1. Switch to the **Custom placeholders** page on the left menu bar and click **Add Placeholder**.
  1. In the appeared dialog, specify a custom placeholder expression using the Expressions syntax elements and click **Create**. <Image src={customPlaceholderExpression} alt="Custom Placeholder Expression" class="width-xl" />
</Steps>

Once the custom placeholders are assigned to the project, project members will see them highlighted in the Editor during the translation process.

## Custom placeholders syntax elements

To configure your custom placeholder expression, you can use the elements from [the expression syntax table](/enterprise/expression-syntax-elements).

For example, if you’d like to highlight this `[[Placeholder1]]`, your expression might look like this:

```
start, then "[[", range "a,z,A,Z,0,9", limit "1,20", then "]]", end
```

To simplify things a bit, let's deconstruct the expression above.

- `start` &ndash; indicates the beginning of the expression.
- `then "[["` &ndash; means that your custom placeholder starts with two opening square brackets.
- `range "a,z,A,Z,0,9"` &ndash; means that your custom placeholder might include characters ranging a-z and/or A-Z and/or 0-9.
- `limit "1,20"` &ndash; means that the length of the placeholder is from 1 to 20 characters.
- `then "]]"` &ndash; means that your custom placeholder ends with two closing square brackets.
- `end` &ndash; indicates the end of the expression.
