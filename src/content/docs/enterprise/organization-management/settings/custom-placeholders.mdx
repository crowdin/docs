Custom Placeholders are designed for cases when the source texts contain some less common placeholders that are not highlighted in the source strings (in the Editor) by default.

## Configure Your Custom Placeholders

You can manage Custom Placeholders in the **Organization Settings**.

<Steps>
  1. Click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner and select **Organization Settings**. <Image src={organizationSettingsMenuItem} alt="Organization Settings" />
  1. Switch to the **Custom placeholders** section on the left sidebar and click **Add Placeholder**.
  1. In the appeared dialog, specify a custom placeholder expression using the Expressions syntax elements and click **Create**. <Image src={customPlaceholderExpression} alt="Custom Placeholder Expression" class="width-xl" />
</Steps>

Once the custom placeholders are assigned to the project, project members will see them highlighted in the Editor during the translation process.

## Understanding the Syntax: A Simple Example

To configure your custom placeholder expression, you can use the elements from [the expression syntax table](/enterprise/expression-syntax-elements/).

For example, if you’d like to highlight this `[[Placeholder1]]`, your expression might look like this:

```
start, then "[[", range "a,z,A,Z,0,9", limit "1,20", then "]]", end
```

To simplify things a bit, let's deconstruct the expression above.

- `start` &ndash; indicates the beginning of the expression.
- `then "[["` &ndash; means that your custom placeholder starts with two opening square brackets.
- `range "a,z,A,Z,0,9"` &ndash; means that your custom placeholder might include characters ranging a-z and/or A-Z and/or 0-9.
- `limit "1,20"` &ndash; means that the length of the placeholder is from 1 to 20 characters.
- `then "]]"` &ndash; means that your custom placeholder ends with two closing square brackets.
- `end` &ndash; indicates the end of the expression.

## Custom Placeholder Expression Examples

Below you can see a few examples of custom placeholder expression and how they will be highlighted in source strings in the Editor.

<Aside>
  All the examples below use the same argument delimiter `"`.
</Aside>

##### Custom placeholder enclosed in percent characters and curly brackets

String example:

```
A test string with a custom %{placeholder}%
```

Expression:

```graphql
start, maybe "(", then "%", then "{", anything,  then "}", maybe ")", then "%", end
```

This expression deconstructed:

* `maybe "("` &ndash; Allows the placeholder to optionally start with a `(`.
* `then "%"` &ndash; Requires a `%` character.
* `then "{"` &ndash; Requires a `{` character.
* `anything` &ndash; Matches any character or sequence of characters inside the placeholder.
* `then "}"` &ndash; Requires a `}` character.
* `maybe ")"` &ndash; Allows the placeholder to optionally end with a `)`.
* `then "%"` &ndash; Requires a `%` character.

##### Custom placeholder enclosed in double square brackets

String example:

```
A test string with a custom [[placeholder]]
```

Expression:

```graphql
start, then "[[", anythingbut "[[", then "]]", multiple, end
```

This expression deconstructed:

* `then "[["` &ndash; Requires the placeholder to start with `[[`.
* `anythingbut "[["` &ndash; Matches any character *except* the opening `[[` brackets.
* `then "]]"` &ndash; Requires the placeholder to end with `]]`.
* `multiple` &ndash; Allows the pattern (the content inside the brackets) to repeat.

##### Custom placeholder

String example:

```
A test string with a custom placeholder
```

Expression:

```graphql
start, then "placeholder", end
```

##### Custom placeholder enclosed in paragraph characters

String example:

```
A test string with a custom §placeholder§
```

Expression:

```graphql
start, then "§", anything,  then "§", end
```

##### Long sentence that you might want to highlight as a single custom placeholder

String example:

```text wrap
A test string with a Long sentence that you might want to highlight as a single custom placeholder
```

Expression:

```graphql wrap
start, then "Long sentence that you might want to highlight as a single custom placeholder", end
```
