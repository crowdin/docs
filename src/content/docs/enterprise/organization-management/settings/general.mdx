## Organization Info

Manage the essential details of your organization, including its name, logo, and public presence. You can update your organization’s name and upload a new logo, ensuring your organization’s branding is always current.

### Public Organization

In the **Public Organization** section, manage how your organization is presented to the public. Add a description, select the project view (List or Grid), and choose up to six featured projects to showcase.

A public page is automatically created when you publish a project with the Crowdsourcing workflow step.

If you are a [Vendor](/enterprise/for-vendors/), your organization info will be visible to your Clients, and you will also see their organization info.

### Custom Domain

Configure a **Custom Domain** to host your Crowdin Enterprise organization on your own domain. This feature is particularly useful if you have crowdsourcing projects, as it can help attract more contributors to get involved in translating your projects.

To set up a custom domain, create a CNAME record with your DNS provider that points to `org.cname.crowdin.com`. Ensure that you use this specific address without modifications, as the domain specified below will be automatically detected.

<Aside>
  If you don't have any public projects, your custom domain will redirect visitors to the Crowdin Enterprise Console.

## Account Defaults

Configure the default settings for the Editor across your organization. Choose the default view mode (Side-by-Side, Comfortable, Multilingual, or Multilingual (Grid)) that best suits your workflow. You can lock this setting to enforce the selected view for all users, preventing any individual changes in their Editor settings.

## Authentication

The **Authentication** section allows you to configure how users join and access your organization. You can fine-tune security settings and manage various authentication methods based on your preferences.

With Security options, you can enhance your organization’s security by enabling features like two-factor authentication, which requires users to verify their identity through an additional step. Additionally, configure the IP allowlist to restrict access to only connections from approved IP addresses, helping maintain strict control over access to your organization’s resources.

You can also manage authentication methods for user sign-ins. Use Crowdin Enterprise's built-in options or choose from various external methods, including social logins via Google, Facebook, GitHub, GitLab, and X. For advanced security, enable Passkey for a passwordless experience or integrate with existing identity providers using OpenID Connect and [SAML](/enterprise/saml/). These options simplify the authentication process while ensuring robust security for your organization.

In the **Billing** section, you can manage your subscription plan, view payment history, and handle app subscriptions. You can upgrade or downgrade your plan based on your needs, and access detailed information about your organization’s usage and invoicing.

### Subscription Plan

Review your current subscription plan, which includes details such as the plan name, the date of the last plan change, and your current usage limits. You can also see how many managers and words are currently used out of the total allowed, as well as the status of additional features like permission granularity and IP allowlist.

## Custom QA Checks

In the **Custom QA Checks** section, create, add, and manage QA checks tailored to your specific needs. These QA checks help verify translations against rules not covered by default checks. Manage your installed QA checks by viewing, updating, or deleting them as needed.

[Create Custom QA Checks](/enterprise/custom-qa-checks/) from scratch using a JavaScript-based code snippet, or add pre-made ones from the [Crowdin Store](https://store.crowdin.com/types/qa-check). Additionally, install External QA checks as Crowdin Apps from the Crowdin Store to extend your organization’s QA capabilities.

Once added, [assign these QA checks](/enterprise/project-settings/qa-checks/#configure-qa-checks) to your projects.

## Spellcheckers

Integrate custom spellcheckers to enhance translation quality by checking translations against specialized rules not covered by default settings. You can add spellcheckers from the [Crowdin Store](https://store.crowdin.com/tags/spellcheck) and manage their settings, including reviewing supported languages and real-time verification mode.

## Webhooks

In the **Webhooks** section, you can configure organization webhooks to receive notifications about key events that happen in your organization. Once set up, Crowdin Enterprise will send POST or GET requests with data to the specified webhook URL via HTTP when these events occur.

You can create organization webhooks for the following event types:

* Group created
* Group deleted
* Project created
* Project deleted

## Permission Granularity

Enable [Permission Granularity Mode](/enterprise/permissions-granularity-mode/) to manage project groups as separate units inside one Crowdin Enterprise account. You can then add projects to specific groups or subgroups. This mode allows working with workflow templates, translation memories, glossaries, and machine translations for each project group separately. When you assign group managers, they will have access to all project resources except the **Settings** and **Managers** sections.

## OAuth Apps

Create an OAuth app that can be used to make authorized requests to the Crowdin Enterprise API or as a Single Sign-On service. You can build custom integrations and give them access to use your account on your behalf. Only organization admins will be able to modify its credentials or delete an OAuth app to revoke its access.

Some of the most common uses for this functionality include:

* OAuth apps let you make authorized requests to [API](/developer/api/).
* OAuth apps are often used as a Single Sign-On service. You can allow users to sign in your service with their Crowdin Enterprise accounts.

## Danger Zone

You can transfer ownership or delete your organization from Crowdin Enterprise. Before deleting, you can export some of your organization's data, including invoices.

### Transfer Ownership

The organization ownership transfer action facilitates the seamless transition of administrative control from one user to another within the organization. This process includes initiating the transfer, designating a new owner, executing the transfer, and providing retained administrative access for the former owner.

Before you transfer ownership:

- Grant admin access to the user you want to assign ownership to.

### Delete Organization

Deleting organization is permanent. It removes all the info associated with this organization. This means all the projects, organization accounts, localization resources, and other related data become irretrievable.

Before you delete the organization:

- Consider exporting your organization data (including TMs, glossaries, workflow templates).
- Download the invoices and transaction history for each subscription.

<Aside type="danger">
  If you delete your organization, you won't be able to restore it.
