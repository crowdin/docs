## Organization Info

Update the main organization details, such as name and logo.

### Public Organization

In the **Public organization** section, you can add a public description, select the preferred project view, and select featured projects.

These details will be visible on your organization's public page. The public page is automatically created once you add the Crowdsourcing workflow step to at least one project.

If you are a [Vendor](/enterprise/for-vendors), your organization info will be visible to your Clients, and you will also see their organization info.

### Custom Domain

Configure a **Custom domain** to publish your Crowdin Enterprise organization on your own domain. Use a custom domain if you have crowdsourcing projects. It can help to attract more contributors to get involved in translations of your projects.

To get access to the custom domain name – create a CNAME record with your DNS provider that points to `org.cname.crowdin.com` (ensure to use this specific address with no modifications, the domain specified below will be detected automatically).

<Aside>
  If you don't have any public projects, your custom domain name will redirect you to Crowdin Enterprise Console.

## Authentication

Customize organization-wide authentication settings. You can control how people can join your organization, enable two-factor authentication for additional security, and configure the IP allowlist to allow only connections from allowed IP addresses into your organization.

Manage the authentication methods people can use to join your organization. You can use Crowdin Enterprise's built-in authentication or select one of the external single sign-on (SSO) services to authenticate your organization's users. You can enable OpenID Connect or [SAML](/enterprise/saml) authentication so that users don't have to create separate Crowdin Enterprise accounts.

## Apps

Manage your organization's currently installed Crowdin Apps. You can also install Crowdin Apps developed by Crowdin and other developers from the Crowdin [Store](https://store.crowdin.com/) or manually install a Crowdin App of your own development.

## Custom QA checks

Create custom QA checks from scratch or add existing ones from the [Crowdin Store](https://store.crowdin.com/types/qa-check), which you can assign to preferred projects.

## Webhooks

Create organization webhooks to be notified about events in your organization. You can create webhooks for the following event types:

## Custom Languages

Add a custom language if one of your target languages is missing among supported languages. Follow these steps:

<Steps>

  1. Specify a language name and choose the main language if a custom language is a dialect.
  1. Define and fill in language codes.
  1. Set text direction and select plural form.

Custom language codes will then be automatically added to corresponding language placeholders whenever used. You can also create custom codes for your custom languages using [Language Mapping](/enterprise/project-settings/languages/#language-mapping).

## Permission Granularity

Enable [Permission Granularity Mode](/enterprise/permissions-granularity-mode) to manage project groups as separate units inside one Crowdin Enterprise account. You can then add projects to specific groups or subgroups. This mode allows working with workflow templates, translation memories, glossaries, and machine translations for each project group separately. When you assign group managers, they will have access to all project resources except the **Settings** and **Managers** tabs.

## OAuth Apps

Create an OAuth app that can be used to make authorized requests to the Crowdin Enterprise API or as a Single Sign-On service. You can build custom integrations and give them access to use your account on your behalf. Only organization admins will be able to modify its credentials or delete an OAuth app to revoke its access.

Some of the most common uses for this functionality include:

* OAuth apps let you make authorized requests to [Crowdin Enterprise API](https://support.crowdin.com/enterprise/api/).
* OAuth apps are often used as a Single Sign-On service. You can allow users to sign in your service with their Crowdin Enterprise accounts.

### Adding a New Application

<Steps>
  1. In the upper-right corner, click your profile photo and select *Organization Settings*.
  2. Select *OAuth apps* tab and click **New App**.
  3. On the *Create application* page, enter the following information:
      * **Application name** and **Application description** (optional) will be shown to users when they authorize the app with access to their Crowdin Enterprise accounts.
      * **Authorization callback URLs** are the URLs where users will be sent after they authorize with Crowdin Enterprise. You can add multiple URLs separated by a comma (no need to use quotation marks).
      * Select the access your app requires from the list of [Scopes](https://developer.crowdin.com/understanding-scopes/) available.
  4. Click **Create Application**.
</Steps>

<Aside>
  By default, newly created OAuth apps are restricted to the app owner’s Crowdin projects. To make them available Crowdin-wide, [Contact Support Team](https://crowdin.com/contacts) with the respective request.
</Aside>

### Modifying an OAuth App

After creating an OAuth application, organization admins can make changes to it. Go to **Organization Settings > OAuth apps** tab to see the list of OAuth apps added for your organization.

Click the necessary app to be able to:

* Update the application name, description, URLs, and scopes.
* Delete the application.
* Check how many organization users are using the app.
* Access Client ID and Client Secret of the created application.
* Reset Client Secret for the app.
* Revoke all user tokens.

## Security Log

Track important events that happen on the organizational level. Security log includes events such as logins, passwords, usernames, and email changes, etc. Click on the needed event to see the following details: Event type, Location, IP, Device, and Date. Use filters to find specific event types and users.

## Legal and Compliance

View information about Crowdin's policies, terms of service, and compliance standards, as well as Crowdin's commitment to data security and privacy.

## Danger Zone

You can transfer ownership or delete your organization from Crowdin Enterprise. Before deleting, you can export some of your organization's data, including invoices.

### Transfer Ownership

The organization ownership transfer action facilitates the seamless transition of administrative control from one user to another within the organization. This process includes initiating the transfer, designating a new owner, executing the transfer, and providing retained administrative access for the former owner.

Before you transfer ownership:

-  Grant admin access to the user you want to assign ownership to.

### Delete Organization

Deleting organization is permanent. It removes all the info associated with this organization. This means all the projects, organization accounts, localization resources, and other related data become irretrievable.

Before you delete the organization:

- Consider exporting your organization data (including TMs, glossaries, workflow templates).
- Download the invoices and transaction history for each subscription.

  If you delete your organization, you won't be able to restore it.
