OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication method built on the OAuth 2.0 protocol, allowing users to log in to Crowdin Enterprise through your organization’s identity provider (IDP).

OIDC offers simplicity in configuration and user management while enhancing security and access control. It’s an ideal choice for organizations looking for streamlined authentication with a focus on ease of integration and scalability.

## Configure your identity provider

To get started, you’ll need to set up a connection (or connector) for Crowdin Enterprise with your IDP (for example, [Okta](https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/create-an-oidc-web-app-in-dashboard), [Auth0](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/auth0-overview/create-applications), and others).

</CardGrid>

## Set up OpenID Connect for Crowdin Enterprise

Once you configured your identity provider, an Organization admin can enable the OpenID Connect in Crowdin Enterprise **Organization Settings**.

<Steps>
  1. Click on your profile picture in the upper-right corner and select **Organization Settings**.
  2. Switch to the **Authentication** section on the left sidebar and click on the **OpenID Connect** authentication method at the bottom of the page. <Image src={authenticationMethod} alt="OpenID Connect authentication method" />
  3. Paste your credentials from your IDP and click **Save**. <Image src={idpCredentials} alt="OpenID Connect IDP credentials" />
  4. Go back to the **Authentication** page and enable the OpenID Connect authentication method.
  5. As a result, on the login page, users will be able to use OpenID Connect for logging into your Crowdin Enterprise organization.
</Steps>

## OpenID Connect Settings

The **OpenID Connect Auth Settings** page allows you to configure the details required for enabling OpenID Connect authentication within your Crowdin Enterprise organization.

* **Redirect URL** &ndash; the URL where the user will be redirected after authentication. Crowdin Enterprise automatically generates this URL based on your organization’s domain, and it must be registered with your IDP.
* **Method Name** &ndash; the name you assign for the OpenID Connect authentication method, which will appear on your Crowdin Enterprise login page. This helps users identify the authentication option when logging in.
* **Client ID** &ndash; the unique identifier provided by your IDP during the OpenID Connect setup process. It distinguishes your Crowdin Enterprise application and enables secure communication with the IDP.
* **Client Secret** &ndash; enter the Client Secret provided by your IDP, ensuring it is stored securely as it grants access to authenticate users.
* **Provider URL** &ndash; enter your IDP’s authorization URL to enable communication between Crowdin Enterprise and the IDP. Refer to your IDP’s documentation for this URL.
* **Allow Invited Registration Without Invitation Links** &ndash; invited users can register without a dedicated invitation link. The system automatically grants permissions only if the user’s email (validated by the OIDC provider) matches an entry on your invitation list.

## What you get when OpenID Connect is enabled

Once OpenID Connect (OIDC) is set up and enabled, any users already logged in will remain logged in. From that point on, users who choose OIDC as their login method will access your Crowdin Enterprise organization using their IDP credentials. If a user does not yet have an account in your Crowdin Enterprise organization, an account will be created automatically during their first login.
