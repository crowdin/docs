Clients are organizations to which you can provide translation services within shared projects. In the **Clients** section of your workspace, you'll find a list of all the clients you collaborate with.

The client organization can [invite vendors](/enterprise/vendors#inviting-an-existing-organization-to-be-a-vendor) either by using a subdomain in Crowdin or a shareable link. In the first case, the client organization will need your organization's name to send you the vendor invitation. Once you confirm the invitation, this organization can assign you to the workflow steps of their projects.

If you have clients you'd like to collaborate with in Crowdin Enterprise, you can invite them using a shareable link:

<Steps>
  1. Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Clients** on the left sidebar.
  1. Click the **Invite** button at the bottom right.
  1. Click <Icon name="mdi:link" class="inline-icon" /> **Copy Link**.

  1. Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Clients** on the left sidebar.
  1. Click <Icon name="mdi:email-outline" class="inline-icon" /> **Contact** next to the needed client.

## Confirm a Client Request

To accept a request from a Client and start cooperation, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your organization's **Workspace** and select **Clients** on the left sidebar.

## Incoming Projects

The **Incoming Projects** section will contain all the projects you're working on as a vendor.

If your organization is assigned to work on a project, you'll see a pending request and will be able to add it to your workspace. You can organize incoming projects into groups for easier navigation and user management.

## Organization Rates

As a Vendor, you can configure default and language-specific rates for your organization. These are the rates you will charge the client for translation and proofreading performed by the members of your organization.

<Aside>
  You will negotiate the specific rates and how your payments will be processed directly with the client who assigns your organization to the project as a vendor.
