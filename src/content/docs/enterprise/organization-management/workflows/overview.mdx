Workflow is a sequence of steps that content in your project should go through, like translation or proofreading. You can use unlimited workflow steps that can be connected both in parallel or subsequently.

You can create a workflow template that works best for you and then assign it to several projects. Editing a workflow after it's assigned to your project from a template, won't affect the workflow template in any way. Otherwise, you can create a new workflow each time you create a project.

## Creating a Workflow template

To create a Workflow template, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your organization's **Workspace > Workflow templates**.
  1. At the bottom right click **Create**. <Image src={createWorkflow} alt="Create Workflow" />
  1. Name your Workflow and add a description(optional).
  1. Click **Create**.
  1. Select workflow steps from the left and drag them to the working area.
  1. Connect steps in the order the content should flow between them. Steps can be connected in parallel or subsequently.
  1. (Optional) Add target languages to each step and assign contributors to them. This can be skipped when creating a template, as you might want to add different languages and assignees for different projects.
  1. When you're done creating your workflow, click **Save**. <Image src={workflowCreation} alt="Workflow Creation" />
</Steps>

Your new template will be available for you to use on the Workflow templates page and in the workflow list when creating a project.

## Workflow Steps

Hereâ€™s a list of the workflow steps that you can use to create a workflow.

#### Switch Source Language

Add the Switch Source Language step to change your current source language to the new one to facilitate translation between rare or less common language pairs.

#### TM Pre-translation

Select languages that should be pre-translated. Enable Auto-Substitution if you want to get improved suggestions where possible. Pre-translate strings with a configurable Translation Memory match (select from 40% to 100% match ratio) or with a perfect match.

#### MT Pre-translation

Configure Machine Translation engines first. Then select the ones you need from the drop-down list and select languages. You can currently connect Google Translate, Microsoft Translator, DeepL Pro, Amazon Translate, and Watson (IBM) Translate.

#### Translation

Select target languages and assignees for each language.

#### Translation by Vendor

Select the Vendor you want to assign to this step and target languages. Add a comment, that vendor will receive along with a copy of the content from this step.

#### Translation by API Vendor

Order professional translations from Translation Agencies that provide their services via API integration. You can choose between manual or completely automated translation orders.

#### Proofreading

Select target languages and assignees for each language.

#### Proofreading by Vendor

Select the Vendor you want to assign to this step and target languages. Add a comment, that vendor will receive along with a copy of the content from this step.
