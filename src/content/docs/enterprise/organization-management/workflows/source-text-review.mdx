Source Text Review is a workflow step used to review and correct source texts for grammar, consistency, formatting, and style before translation begins.

This step is particularly useful when your [translation strategy](/enterprise/translation-strategies/) involves hired professional translators, as reviewed and corrected source texts help prevent unnecessary translation costs and improve the overall quality.

## Adding Source Text Review Step to Your Workflow

Source Text Review is available as a workflow step that can be added in the Workflow Editor or in the Workflow template editor. Once added, the step becomes available to all managers working on the project.

## Reviewing Source Texts in Your Project

Once you add the Source Text Review step to your project's workflow, a corresponding section appears on the project's **Dashboard** page. Click **Review** to open the Editor in Review mode.

In Review mode, go through the source texts and make corrections where needed.

If the source text is correct, click <Icon name="mdi:check" class="inline-icon" /> **Approve**. The string will be marked <Icon name="done" size="24" class="inline-icon align-middle" /> **Done** and will immediately appear on the next workflow step.

If the source text requires edits, enter the corrected version and click **Save**. The string will get approved automatically and be marked <Icon name="pending" size="24" class="inline-icon align-middle" /> **Pending**, meaning the source file requires an update with the reviewed texts.

## Applying Reviewed Texts

To apply all reviewed texts to the source files, go to the **Dashboard** page and click **Apply reviewed**.

If any of your corrections (**New strings**) differ from the original source text (**Current strings**), the **Keep translations for changed strings** dialog will appear. This dialog gives you precise control over which existing translations and approvals are kept for the strings you've modified.

In this dialog, review the list of changed strings:
* **Keep Translations**: Select the checkbox for each string for which you want to preserve the existing translations. If you *do not* select a string, its existing translations will be removed when the source text is updated.
* **Keep approvals**: Select this option at the bottom to also preserve the approvals for the translations you've chosen to keep.

Click **Update File** to confirm your selection and complete the update. After the source file update, the corrected strings will be marked **Done** and be available on the next workflow step.

<Aside type="tip">
  This step is also important for managing string duplicates. If a correction causes a string to become a duplicate of another (based on your project's [duplicate management settings](/enterprise/project-settings/import/#duplicate-strings)), *not* keeping its translations can help ensure it properly merges as a duplicate and inherits translations from the new master string.
</Aside>

When all strings are reviewed, the Source Text Review progress reaches 100%.

Optionally, click **Download reviewed** on the **Dashboard** page to export the reviewed source file and update your local version if needed.

<QuestionAnswer title="Why should I download the corrected files and replace my local source files with them?">
  To avoid situations where a local source file later overwrites the corrected texts in Crowdin Enterprise during the next source file upload.
