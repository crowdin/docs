Source Text Review is a workflow step used to review and correct source texts for grammar, consistency, formatting, and style before translation begins.

This step is particularly useful when your [translation strategy](/enterprise/translation-strategies/) involves hired professional translators, as reviewed and corrected source texts help prevent unnecessary translation costs and improve the overall quality.

## Reviewing Source Texts in Your Project

Once you add the Source Text Review step to your project's workflow, a corresponding section appears on the project's **Dashboard** page. Click **Review** to open the Editor in Review mode.

In Review mode, go through the source texts and make corrections where needed.

If the source text is correct, click <Icon name="mdi:check" class="inline-icon" /> **Approve**. The string will be marked *Done* and will immediately appear on the next workflow step.

If the source text requires edits, enter the corrected version and click **Save**. The string will get approved automatically and be marked *ToDo*, meaning the source file requires an update with the reviewed texts.

To apply all reviewed texts to the source files, go to the **Dashboard** page and click **Apply reviewed**. After the source file update, the corrected strings will be marked *Done* and be available on the next workflow step.

When all strings are reviewed, the Source Text Review progress reaches 100%.

Optionally, click **Download reviewed** on the **Dashboard** page to export the reviewed source file and update your local version if needed.

<QuestionAnswer title="Why should I download the corrected files and replace my local source files with them?">
  To avoid situations where a local source file later overwrites the corrected texts in Crowdin Enterprise during the next source file upload.
