Translation by API Vendor is a workflow step used to order translations from vendors integrated with Crowdin Enterprise via API. It helps automate the translation process by enabling manual or scheduled order placement, with translations delivered directly to your project.

## Adding Translation by API Vendor Step to Your Workflow

You can add the *Translation by API Vendor* step in the workflow editor or the workflow template editor. In the step settings, select the vendor (e.g., Gengo) from the *Vendor* drop-down. If needed, adjust additional options like *Expertise*, *Tone*, and *Purpose* to match your requirements.

## Ordering Translations from API Vendor

Once the step is added to your project workflow, the *API Vendor* tab becomes available in the **Workflow** section of the project.

To order translations, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Workflow > API Vendor**.
  2. Choose the target languages.
  3. Click **Create order**. <Image src={createOrder} alt="Create order" />
  4. *(Optional)* Enable **Automatically order translations (every hour)** if you want translation orders to be sent periodically without manual action.
</Steps>

As soon as the translations are completed by the vendor, they will be delivered back into the project automatically.

## Orders History

To track past orders, scroll down to the **Orders history** section on the **Workflow > API Vendor** page. This section shows each order's language, word count, status, and price. For more detailed order information, click the specific order entry.

You can also view orders across all your projects by going to **Workspace > Vendors** and selecting the needed vendor (e.g., Gengo). On the **Orders** tab, use the available filters (e.g., Project, Language, Status, Created) to narrow down the results and check relevant order details.
