An organization consolidates all company members involved in localization and contributors (translators, proofreaders, vendors, etc.) in one space.

Within your organization, you can:

* Create and manage projects individually or as part of groups.
* Create workflow templates and apply them to individual projects and groups.
* Grant admin access at different levels.
* Assign translators, proofreaders, and vendors to specific workflow steps.
* Use [built-in AI features](/enterprise/crowdin-ai/) to improve translation quality and productivity.
* Extend functionality with apps and integrations from the [Crowdin Store](https://store.crowdin.com/).

## Creating an Organization

When you create an organization in Crowdin Enterprise, you also create your personal account and automatically become the organization owner. The owner has full access to organization-level settings, billing, user management, and more. Other users [join existing organizations by invitation](#signing-up-by-an-invitation) and become their members.

To create your organization and sign up for your account, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open the signup page.
  1. Select your preferred data center (**US Data Center** or **EU Data Center**). This defines where your organization’s data (files, strings, and other resources) will be stored.
  1. Enter your organization's name. It will also be used in the URL (e.g., `organization-name.crowdin.com`).
  1. Fill in all the fields with your account data and click **Create Organization**. <Image src={createWorkspace} alt="Creating an organization" class="width-lg" />
  1. Go to your inbox, open the activation email, and click **Activate Organization**.
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  The organization name used in the URL cannot be changed. All other personal data can be changed in your [Account Settings](/enterprise/account-settings/).
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
  You can set up a [custom domain](/enterprise/organization-settings/#custom-domain) if you want to use your own URL for the organization. This is especially useful for public projects or crowdsourcing initiatives.
</Aside>
