An organization consolidates all company members involved in localization and contributors (translators, proofreaders, vendors, etc.) in one space.

Within your organization, you can:

* Create and manage individual projects and projects organized into groups.
* Add workflow templates and apply them to individual projects and groups.
* Grant admin access at different levels.
* Assign translators, proofreaders, and vendors to workflow steps.
