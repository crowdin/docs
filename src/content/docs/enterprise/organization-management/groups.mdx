Groups help you organize related projects into a clear hierarchy, similar to folders. You can nest groups into subgroups to structure your workspace and manage access more efficiently.

## Use Cases

Groups are useful for organizing and managing projects based on their type, purpose, or ownership. You can:

* Organize projects by content type (e.g., documentation, marketing materials), product line (e.g., mobile apps, games), or department (e.g., development, support).
* Assign managers to a group to give them access to all its projects at once.
* Create and manage workflow templates specific to the group.
* Share localization resources, such as translation memories, glossaries, or MT engines, within the group or subgroup.
* For translation vendors, group incoming projects by client to simplify access and resource management.

## Permission Granularity Mode

When your organization uses [Permission Granularity Mode](/enterprise/permissions-granularity-mode/), you can manage resources and permissions separately for each project group. This allows you to:

* Create workflow templates specific to each group.
* Manage translation memories and glossaries at the group level.
* Connect MT engines for a specific group.
* Assign managers to all projects within a group at once.

## Shared Resources

Localization resources such as translation Memories, glossaries, MT engines, and workflows added at the organization level are available in all projects. If you add resources to a specific group or subgroup, they’ll be available only to the projects within that group or subgroup.

## Manager Permissions

Managers assigned to a group automatically inherit the same permissions for its subgroups and projects.

## Navigation

To navigate between groups and subgroups, use the sidebar menu or click the folder icons directly. If the group hierarchy isn’t visible in the sidebar, click the <Icon name="mdi:view-column" class="inline-icon" /> **Workspace Explorer** button in the lower-left corner to open the list of groups.
