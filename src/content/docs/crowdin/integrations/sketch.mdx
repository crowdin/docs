With the Crowdin plugin for Sketch, you can use texts from Crowdin in your designs to save time for both designers and developers. These could include original or translated texts. If necessary, you can add new ones (e.g., dialog titles, button labels) and send them to translators in Crowdin.

## Use Cases

* Quickly generate multilingual creative assets.
* Translate mockups and test them in different languages before the programming starts.
* Stop using 'Lorem Ipsum', add real texts from Crowdin to your prototypes instead.
* Create and upload source strings from your designs to your Crowdin project. This way, uploaded strings could be used by developers, which reduces time spent on development.
* Upload tagged screenshots to your Crowdin project.

## UI Localization

Use the *Strings* tab when localizing UI and working on dynamic pages with your development and marketing teams. In this tab, you can add source strings from Crowdin to your designs in Sketch in a click.

### Using Source Strings from Crowdin in Sketch

<Steps>
  1. Open the Crowdin plugin for Sketch.
  2. In the *Strings* tab, use the *Search* field to find the specific copy. You can search strings by source text, string identifier, or context.
  3. Select the text layer you want to add text to and click on the needed string.
</Steps>

<Image src={stringsTab} alt="Sketch Plugin Using Source Strings from Crowdin in Sketch" />

After using the source strings from Crowdin in your designs, you can [preview translations](#previewing-strings) for these strings in Sketch and [upload screenshots](#uploading-tagged-screenshots-to-crowdin) for them to your Crowdin project.

### Adding Source Strings from Sketch to Crowdin

You can add the strings that are already used in the designs or create and add completely new strings.

<Steps>
  1. Open the Crowdin plugin for Sketch.
  2. To add the strings used in the designs, select the whole artboard, multiple artboards, or the needed strings on the artboards. Alternatively, skip this step if you want to add a new string.
  3. In the *Strings* tab, click **Add String**.
  4. In the appeared dialog, fill in the required fields.
  5. (Optional) To add labels to the strings, alternately select them from the **Label** drop-down menu and click **Save**.
</Steps>

<Image src={addStrings} alt="Sketch Plugin Add Source Strings from Sketch to Crowdin" />

To add the same strings into multiple files in Crowdin, alternately select the needed files from the **File** drop-down menu.

If some artboards contain hidden elements that should not be added to Crowdin, clear the **Push hidden elements** option.

Added strings will be transferred to your Crowdin project and also will be displayed in the list of the **Strings** tab. You can edit or delete the strings from the same list anytime. The respective changes will also be applied to the strings in your Crowdin project.

### Key Naming Pattern Settings

To simplify adding strings from Sketch to the Crowdin project, you can set up the desired key naming pattern for the source string identifiers in the plugin settings. The Crowdin plugin for Sketch will suggest the string identifiers for new strings based on the selected pattern. While adding new source strings, you can always edit the suggested identifier to the preferred look.

To select the key naming pattern, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open the Crowdin plugin for Sketch.

## Marketing Visuals Localization

Use the *Translation* tab to localize static pages, like brochures and banners. In this tab, you can send texts with context for translators to Crowdin and upload translated copies back to Sketch.

### Sending Texts for Translation to Crowdin

You can send text for translation either from selected or all artboards from a Sketch file. Translators will work with those texts in the list view and use designs as an additional context for even higher translation quality.

In Crowdin, a root folder *Sketch plugin* will be created. It will contain a subfolder named after your Sketch file with HTML files for each artboard inside. If needed, you can disable content segmentation in the plugin **Settings** so the long texts will not be split into sentences.

To send Sketch designs for translation, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open the necessary Sketch file.
  2. Go to **Plugins > Crowdin**.
  3. In the *Translation* tab, *Send Texts* section, select content you’d like to translate. Select *Page* or *Artboard*.
</Steps>

<Image src={translationTabSendTexts} alt="Sketch Plugin Send Texts for Translation to Crowdin" />

When the source files are uploaded to your Crowdin project, you can invite contributors to translate and proofread them.

### Uploading Translations from Crowdin to Sketch

You can synchronize texts between Sketch and Crowdin projects whenever you want to test the translated copy inside Sketch or generate multilingual assets.

To upload translated copies to Sketch, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open the necessary Sketch file.
  2. Go to **Plugins > Crowdin**.
  3. In the *Translation* tab, *Get Translations* section, select the target language you want to upload translations for. You can also Select *All languages*.
  4. Select the content you want to preview in Sketch. Select *Page* or *Artboard*.
</Steps>

<Image src={translationTabGetTranslations} alt="Sketch Plugin Get Translations" />

After uploading translations to Sketch, the modified file will contain a separate artboard with translations for each target language. The newly uploaded translated versions won’t override the ones you uploaded previously. You can always delete the translated copies you no longer need.

<Image src={uploadedTranslations} alt="Sketch Plugin Uploaded Translations" />

If you'd like the newly uploaded translated versions to override the previously uploaded ones, open the plugin **Settings** and select **Override existing translations**.
