## VCS Integrations

The key challenge engineers face is the lack of automation. Source content needs to be constantly extracted from the codebase and handed over to the translation team. Completed translations should then be integrated back into the codebase. Without an automated approach, this workflow becomes a repetitive and time-consuming exchange of files.

With the automation provided by VCS Integrations, source strings are pulled automatically, ensuring they are always up-to-date for your translators. Completed translations are then pushed back to your repository as a request.

## Design

Quickly generate language-specific assets. Send content for translation with context for translators, while you're working on the mock-ups or polishing prototypes.

## Starred Apps

You can star an app by clicking the <Icon name="mdi:star-outline" class="inline-icon" /> icon next to its name, either from the app list or within the app itself, allowing you to mark apps for quick access. This feature is available for integrations and tools (excluding service-related items like Webhooks, Service Logs, etc.) and is accessible to project members with the Developer role or higher.

Once you star an app, it gets pinned to the top of the relevant tabs, such as **Integrations** or **Tools**. Additionally, a new button will appear in the project **Dashboard**, providing quick access to all your starred apps. The app list will also automatically sort by starred items when you add a new favorite.

Starring works on an individual account basis, meaning each project member will see their own starred apps in the **Integrations**, **Tools**, and project **Dashboard** tabs, independent of other members' selections.
