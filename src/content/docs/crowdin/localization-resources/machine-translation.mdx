Machine translation engines integrated with Crowdin provide translation suggestions from automatic translation services like Google Translate and AutoML Translation, Microsoft Translate, and more.

Suggestions made by machine engines are displayed in the Editor under the translators’ suggestions field. Also, you can do [Pre-Translation](/pre-translation) using MT engines.
