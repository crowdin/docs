Crowdin aims to provide the latest technology solutions that make translation and localization as easy as possible.

## What is Agile Localization?

Agile localization is an approach that helps you deal with frequently updated content that you want to make available to your customers worldwide. Once you’ve decided to localize your product, it’s important to keep it that way and ensure the new content is also multilingual. This typically includes new features, product updates, documentation, websites, and other user-facing content.

While you’re creating new content, translators can work on translations, so you can get work done faster by working in parallel. The latest content can be available to translators nearly instantly and updated automatically. This way, they can start translating immediately in their own translation environment. At the same time, you can quickly receive finished translations via integrations and other automation tools.

This approach makes it easy to track which content has been updated, requires translation, or is ready for production. So when the new feature is ready for release, translations won’t slow you down, as they are done in parallel.

### Translator's Efficiency

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="Translation Memory (TM)">

    QA checks help you easily and quickly detect and avoid common mistakes. For example, they check translations for missed commas, extra spaces, typos, etc.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Screenshots">
    Screenshots are a great way to improve the quality of translations. They appear under each separate string in the Editor so translators see the exact location of a string in the UI.
