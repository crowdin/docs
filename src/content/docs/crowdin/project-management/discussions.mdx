## Viewing and Filtering Topics

Once you open the **Discussions** tab, you can view and filter project topics using the **Open** or **Closed** pages.

- The **Open** page displays all ongoing topics.
- The **Closed** page displays completed or archived topics.

Each topic is displayed with the following details:

- Subject
- Profile picture, full name, and username of the author
- Date created
- Number of replies
- Last reply time

To filter the displayed topics, click <Icon name="mdi:filter-variant" class="inline-icon" /> and use the available options:

- Languages: All, particular language.
- Author: All, particular author.

To search for a particular topic by its title, type your search phrase in the **Search in topics** field.

To sort topics, click **Sort by** and select one of the available options:

* Newest
* Oldest
* Most commented

## Participating and Replying in Discussions

Once you open a topic, you can see the following details:

* **Title** – the subject of the discussion.
* **Opened Date** – the date when the topic was created.
* **Topic Language** – the language used in the discussion.
* **Number of Messages** – the total count of replies in the topic.

The topic author in a discussion is labeled as **Author**. This label helps participants easily recognize who started the discussion, which can be useful for directing replies, following up on questions, or understanding the context of the original post.

Below the initial message, you can view other users' replies. To contribute to the discussion, enter your reply in the text field.

Use "@" followed by a username to direct your message to a specific person. Before sending your message, you can click **Preview** to see how it will be displayed after sending. This is especially useful if you styled your message with Markdown.

To quote another user's reply in your message, click the three dots on the reply and select **Quote reply**.

## Editing and Deleting Replies

  1. Click <Icon name="mdi:dots-horizontal" class="inline-icon" /> on the needed reply and select **Edit**.
  1. Make the necessary changes to the reply and click **Save** to save changes.
