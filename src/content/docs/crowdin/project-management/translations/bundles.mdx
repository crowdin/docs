Target file bundles or simply Bundles is the feature that allows you to export sets of strings or files in the formats you select, regardless of the original file format.

By default, you can choose from the following three formats: XLIFF, Android XML, and iOS Strings. You can add more target file formats by installing respective applications from the [Crowdin Store](https://store.crowdin.com/tags/string-exporter).

You can work with bundles in several ways:

* Manage bundles manually via the project's UI.
* Connect a VCS integration in Target file bundles mode.
* Manage bundles using OTA Content Delivery.
* Manage bundles using Crowdin CLI and API.

When working with bundles, the primary place to manage (create, edit, and delete) them is the Project page. Once you've created a bundle, you can use it with all the tools listed above.

## Use Cases

The most common use cases are the following:

* You can upload a single source file (e.g., Android XML) to your project, translate it, and then, using bundles, export translations for multiple platforms (e.g., Android XML for the Android app, iOS strings for the iOS app, JSON for the web app, etc.).
* You can have a single spreadsheet (e.g., XLSX or CSV) where you store source strings for all platforms your app is developed for, and each string is labeled with a respective label. Upload this file to your project, translate it, and then create separate bundles for multiple platforms using a combination of source file paths and string labels.
* You can localize your mobile app without source files by combining Crowdin design tool plugins (Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD) to send strings straight to the Crowdin project and export translations in the preferred formats using bundles.
* You can export specific sets of strings for offline translation in XLIFF format and then [upload finished translations](/offline-translation/#uploading-translations) back to Crowdin.

## Managing Bundles in UI

To work with bundles manually, you can configure and download them from your Project page.

### Configuring Bundles

To configure a bundle, follow these steps:

<Tabs syncKey="projectType">
  <TabItem label="File-based project">
    <Steps>
      1. Open your project and go to the **Translations** tab.

      2. Click **Target File Bundles** to expand the respective section and click **Add bundle**.

      3. In the appeared dialog, name your bundle.

      4. Specify the source and resulting file paths. If needed, you can add multiple source path patterns using <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" />. In the right panel, you can preview the structure of the source and translation files based on the specified paths.

      5. (Optional) To ignore some folders or files, click **Add ignored pattern**, specify their respective pattern, and Crowdin will skip these specific files or folders during the bundle generation. If needed, you can add multiple ignore patterns using <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" />.

      6. (Optional) You can specify labels in the **Filter by labels** and **Exclude by labels** fields to filter strings, including or excluding them in the generated bundle. Read more about [Labels](/strings-management#labels).

      7. Select the file format you'd like your strings to be exported in. To add other formats, install the respective applications from our [Store](https://store.crowdin.com/tags/string-exporter).

      8. (Optional) If a bundle file format has a <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon" /> icon, it indicates that it has additional options (e.g., **Copy source to empty target** and **Export Translator’s Comments** for XLIFF (system), **Convert placeholders to target file format** for Android XML (system), etc.) you may use when setting up your bundle. Click the <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon" /> icon on a selected bundle file format and configure it according to your preferences. ![Configure Bundle File Format](./_assets/bundles_configure_format.png)

      9. Click **Save**. ![Create Bundle](./_assets/bundles_create_bundle.png)

      2. Click **Target File Bundles** to expand the respective section and click **Add bundle**.

      3. In the appeared dialog, name your bundle.

      4. Specify the source branches and resulting file paths. If needed, you can add multiple source branch path patterns using <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" />. In the right panel, you can preview the source branches and structure of the translation files based on the specified paths.

      5. (Optional) To ignore some branches, click **Add ignored pattern**, specify their respective pattern, and Crowdin will skip these specific branches during the bundle generation. If needed, you can add multiple ignore patterns using <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon"/>.

      6. (Optional) You can specify labels in the **Filter by labels** and **Exclude by labels** fields to filter strings, including or excluding them in the generated bundle.

      7. Select the file format you'd like your strings to be exported in. To add other formats, install the respective applications from our [Store](https://store.crowdin.com/tags/string-exporter).

      8.

Click the <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon" /> icon on a selected bundle file format and configure it according to your preferences.
