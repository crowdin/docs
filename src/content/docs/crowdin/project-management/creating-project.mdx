To be able to upload your content for localization, create a project first.

## Project Visibility

When creating a project, you can select the preferred *project visibility*:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Public project" icon="magnifier">
    Visible to everyone, searchable via search engines and Crowdin search.
    You can restrict access to specific languages after the project is created.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Private project" icon="seti:lock">
    Visible only to the invited project members.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Project Types

Crowdin offers flexibility in the way you structure and manage your localization projects. There are two main project types: *File-based* and *String-based*.

### <Icon name="mdi:file-document" class="inline-icon"/>File-based Project

The file-based project in Crowdin revolves around uploading source files containing translatable content. This project type is well-suited for scenarios with well-defined source files, such as Android XML, iOS Strings, JSON, and more. It allows for precise mapping between source and translation files, making it a preferred choice for many localization workflows.

### <Icon name="mdi:format-list-bulleted" class="inline-icon"/>String-based Project

In string-based projects, the focus is on managing translatable content as individual strings rather than source files. In this project type, after uploading source files, Crowdin parses them into source strings. Unlike file-based projects, source files aren't stored, and the emphasis is on managing the content at the string level. This approach is beneficial when dealing with projects that involve continuous content updates, dynamic content, or where a string-oriented structure is preferred.

## Creating a Project

To create a project, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. [Log in](https://crowdin.com/login) to your Crowdin account or [Sign up](https://crowdin.com/join) to create one.
  2. Click **Create Project**. <Image src={createProject} alt="Create Project" />
  3. Name your project.
  4. Customize your project address if needed.
  5. Select the preferred project visibility. You can choose between a **Public project** (visible to anyone) or a **Private project** (visible only to the invited project members). For a public project, you can enable **Moderated project joining** in your project **Settings** tab and restrict the possibility of translating for users until you confirm their join requests. Private projects can't be found via search engines and Crowdin search. <Image src={projectVisibility} alt="Project Visibility" />
  6. Select **String-based project** if you want to manage your translatable content as individual strings. Otherwise, keep this option cleared to manage your translatable content as source files.
  7. Select the source and target languages of your project. The source language is the language you're translating from, and the target languages are the ones you're translating into.
     <Aside type="tip">You can select target languages manually or via **Pre-fill** by [copying target languages](/project-settings/languages#copying-target-languages) from another project under your account or using the top 30 languages. If you'd like to translate your project into target languages not officially supported, you can still add them as [custom languages](/project-settings/languages#adding-custom-languages).</Aside>
  8. Select the existing TM and glossary for your new project to be used as defaults. Alternatively, to create your new project with clean resources, leave the **Create new translation memory** and **Create new glossary** options selected. You can change the [default TM](/project-settings/translation-memories/#changing-default-tm) and [default glossary](/project-settings/glossaries/#changing-default-glossary) in the project's **Settings**.
  9. Click **Create Project**.
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  The project address and type cannot be changed once the project is created.
