To be able to upload your content for localization, you first need to create a project.

## Project Visibility

When creating a project, you can select the preferred *project visibility*:

  <Card title="Public project" icon="magnifier">
    Visible to everyone. The project will appear in the global Crowdin search results and be indexed by search engines.
    You can configure collaboration and access settings after the project is created.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Private project" icon="seti:lock">
    Visible only to the invited project members.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Project Types

Crowdin offers flexibility in how you organize and manage your localization process. There are two main project types: *File-based* and *String-based*. Choose the one that best fits how your content is structured and how you plan to manage translations.

### <Icon name="mdi:file-document" class="inline-icon" />File-based Project

A file-based project is the standard localization setup in Crowdin, ideal for translating apps and documents. In this project type, you upload source files containing translatable content. Crowdin scans these files, identifies text for translation, and retains the original files within the project. After translation, you can export the files, preserving the original structure and format.

This project type is ideal when maintaining the original file structure upon export is crucial, and when integrating with version control systems (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Azure Repos) and external data sources.

Crowdin supports [a wide range of formats](/supported-formats/) used in software development and documentation, including Android XML, iOS Strings, JSON, XLIFF, Markdown, DOCX, and more.

#### Use Cases

* Translate app strings and documents stored in structured files.
* Maintain the original folder and file structure when exporting translations.
* Keep source files in sync with code repositories.
* Align localization with development and release workflows.
* Suitable for version-controlled content or structured documents.

### <Icon name="mdi:format-list-bulleted" class="inline-icon" />String-based Project

A string-based project in Crowdin is designed for managing dynamic content through a centralized string repository. Instead of storing source files, Crowdin extracts individual translatable strings and maintains them within the platform. This setup is ideal for content that changes frequently, such as UI text and other modular content blocks.

With this approach, you can update source strings directly in Crowdin without needing to re-upload files. Translated strings can then be exported in various formats, including JSON, iOS Strings, or Android XML, facilitating reuse across multiple platforms like web, mobile, and desktop.

#### Use Cases

* Manage and translate app or website UI text in a centralized location.
* Let content writers update source strings online without developer involvement.
* Translate database content without needing to manage source files.
* Avoid duplicate translation effort for strings reused across platforms (e.g., Android, iOS, Web).
* Export translations in your preferred format, including JSON, iOS Strings, or Android XML.
* Ideal for teams working with dynamic content and frequent updates.

<Aside type="caution" title="Limitations">
  Some connectors have limited support, and certain features may not be available in string-based projects.

## Creating a Project

To create a project, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. [Log in](https://crowdin.com/login) to your Crowdin account or [Sign up](https://crowdin.com/join) to create one.
  2. Click **Create Project**. <Image src={createProject} alt="Create Project" />
  3. Enter a **Project name**.
  4. Customize your **Project address** if needed. This will be the public URL for your project.
  5. Select the **Project visibility**. You can choose between a **Public project** (visible to anyone) or a **Private project** (visible only to invited members). Further access controls can be configured in the [project settings](/project-settings/privacy-collaboration/) after creation. <Image src={projectVisibility} alt="Project Visibility" />
  6. Select the **Source language** and **Target languages** for your project. The source language is the language you're translating from, and the target languages are the ones you're translating into.
  7. Choose the project type that best fits your content and localization workflow: [**File-based Project**](#file-based-project) or [**String-based Project**](#string-based-project).
     <Aside type="tip">You can select target languages manually or use the **Pre-fill** option to [copy target languages](/project-settings/languages/#copying-target-languages) from another project under your account or select the top 30 most common languages. To translate into languages not officially supported, you can add them as [custom languages](/project-settings/languages/#adding-custom-languages).</Aside>
  8. *(Optional)* Select **Install Onboarding App** for a guided introduction to Crowdin's features. After project creation, the Onboarding App will launch automatically to help you with initial setup steps.
  9. *(Optional)* Under **Advanced settings**, you can select an existing **Translation Memory** and **Glossary** to be used as defaults for your new project. By default, a new empty TM and Glossary will be created for the project. You can change the [default TM](/project-settings/translation-memories/#changing-default-tm) and [default glossary](/project-settings/glossaries/#changing-default-glossary) in the project's **Settings**.
  10. Click **Create Project**.
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution">
  The project address and type cannot be changed once the project is created.
