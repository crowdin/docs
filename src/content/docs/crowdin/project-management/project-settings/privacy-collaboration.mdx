## Project visibility

Set the preferred visibility for your project with the following options:

* **Public project** &ndash; public projects can be found via search engines and Crowdin search. Crowdin users can join public projects without approval if the **Moderated project joining** option is disabled.
* **Private project** &ndash; private projects can't be found via search engines and Crowdin search. Only the invited users can join the project.

## Privacy

Configure your project privacy settings with the following options:

* **Require two-factor authentication for all the project members** &ndash; request project participants to enable two-factor authentication in their **Account Settings > Password & Connections** tab to access the private project.
* **Moderated project joining** &ndash; require users to send requests to join the translation team of the preferred language. After the review, a project manager or proofreader can approve or decline the request. After joining the project, multilingual translators can submit new requests to join translation teams in other target languages.
* **Task-based access control** &ndash; allow project members to work with tasks they are assigned to, even if they do not have full access to the language in the project.
* **Allow offline translation** &ndash; allow translators to download source files to their machines for offline translation and upload translations back into the project. The project owner and managers can always download sources and upload translations, not depending on the option status.
* **Allow proofreaders to access hidden strings** &ndash; allow proofreaders to work with hidden strings. The project owner and managers can always work with hidden strings, not depending on the option status.
* **Allow project members to manage glossary terms** &ndash; allow translators and proofreaders to add new glossary terms to the project. The project owner and managers can always add and edit glossary terms, not depending on the option status.

## Notifications

Project notifications are disabled by default. Enable the necessary notifications for an agile translation process. Such approach helps to avoid creating additional tasks for every contributor.

* **Notify translators about new strings** &ndash; translators will receive an email notification about newly added content for translation each time after the update.
The **Receive emails** option should be activated in the translatorâ€™s profile.
* **Notify project managers and developers about new strings** &ndash; project managers will receive an email notification about newly added content for translation each time after the update.
* **Notify project managers and developers about language translation/proofreading completion** &ndash; project managers will receive the notification when some target language (all source files) is fully translated or fully proofread.
