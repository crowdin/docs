In the **Privacy & collaboration** section of the project **Settings** tab, you can configure your project's security and access rules, set glossary permissions, and manage team notifications.

## Privacy

This section controls your project's visibility, member access, and general collaboration settings.

* **Two-factor authentication** &ndash; Define which roles are required to have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled to access the project. Users can enable 2FA in their **Account Settings > Account** tab. This role-based option provides the following configurations:
    * **Turned off** &ndash; Two-factor authentication is not required (default).
    * **All project members** &ndash; Requires all project members to enable 2FA.
    * **Managers** &ndash; Requires only members with the Manager role to enable 2FA.
    * **Developers** &ndash; Requires only members with the Developer role to enable 2FA.
    You can select the **Managers** and **Developers** options individually or together. After selecting your preferred categories, click **Update** to save changes.
* **Project Visibility** &ndash; Set the preferred visibility for your project:
    * **Public project** &ndash; Visible to everyone. The project will appear in the global Crowdin search results and be indexed by search engines.
    * **Private project** &ndash; Visible only to the invited project members.
* **Moderated project joining** &ndash; When enabled, users can become translators for a specific language only after their join request is approved by a manager or language coordinator.
    * For **Public projects**, this setting is optional. You can enable it to review and approve new members before they can start contributing.
    * For **Private projects**, this setting is enabled by default and cannot be changed. All project members must be invited, and this setting ensures their access to specific languages is properly managed upon joining.
* **Task-based access control** &ndash; Project members can be assigned specific translation or proofreading tasks for languages without having permanent access to them. This allows you to invite contributors to work only on the content within a task.
  <Aside title="Permissions">
    This option is only available when **Moderated project joining** is enabled.
  </Aside>
  <Aside>
    Users with any role (like translators, proofreaders) in your project will still have access to the content!
    To restrict access to content assigned to users via tasks:
    - Invite users to the project without a role.
    - Create a task and assign it to a user.
  </Aside>
* **Allow offline translation** &ndash; Allows translators to download source files to their machines and upload translations back into the project. Project owner and managers can always download sources and upload translations.
* **Allow proofreaders to access hidden strings** &ndash; Allows proofreaders to work with hidden strings. Project owner and managers can always access hidden strings.

## Glossary Access Settings

Control the level of access that project members have over glossary terms. Project owner and managers always have full control, regardless of these settings.

* **Read only** &ndash; Members can view existing glossary terms but cannot make any changes. This option provides access for reference only.
* **Manage drafts** &ndash; Members can view, add, edit, and delete draft glossary terms, and can also view approved terms. This allows members to contribute to drafts without altering the official, approved terminology.
* **Full access** &ndash; Members can view, add, edit, and delete glossary terms and edit concept details. This provides members with full control over the project glossary.

## Notifications

Enable email notifications to keep project members informed about new content and progress, which helps you avoid creating a separate task for each update.

* **Notify translators about new strings** &ndash; Translators will receive an email notification whenever new content for translation is added to the project.
  <Aside>
    For this notification to be delivered, the translator must also have the **Receive emails** option enabled in their personal profile settings.
  </Aside>
* **Notify project managers and developers about new strings** &ndash; Project managers will receive an email notification whenever new content for translation is added to the project.
* **Notify project managers and developers about language translation/proofreading completion** &ndash; Project managers will receive a notification when a target language is fully translated or proofread.
