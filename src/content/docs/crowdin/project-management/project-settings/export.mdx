By default, when exporting translations, Crowdin fills untranslated strings with source text to avoid exporting empty files. You can change this behavior in the project settings.

## Save context information in the files

The context and max.length added in Crowdin will be visible in the downloaded files. This option only applies to CSV, Android XML, iOS strings, and RESX formats.

<Aside type="caution">
  This option only partially applies to iOS strings and RESX formats (i.e., only the context added in Crowdin will be visible in the downloaded files).
</Aside>

## Skip untranslated strings

Only translated strings will be included in the exported translation files.

This option works in three different ways, depending on the file format. This option is not applied to text-formatted documents since missing texts can make downloaded files unreadable. Others are exported with empty values. And for the third file category, untranslated strings are entirely removed from the exported translation files.

## Skip untranslated files

Only translated files will be included in the exported translation archive.

<Aside>
  if this option is enabled, it overrides the effect of the *Skip untranslated strings* option.
</Aside>

## Export only approved translations

Only texts that are both translated and approved will be included in the exported translation files.

## Automatically fill in regional dialects

Useful when the project is translated into the language dialects (e.g., Spanish, Argentina).

On export, translations from Spanish will be automatically copied to untranslated strings in Spanish, Argentina.
