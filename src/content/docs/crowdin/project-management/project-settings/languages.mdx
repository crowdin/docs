In the Languages section, you can manage your project source and target languages and configure language mapping to use custom language codes.

## Source Language

The source language is the language you're translating from. If you want to change the source language for your project, select a new language from the drop-down list and click **Update**.

Here are a few points you should be aware of when changing the project’s source language:

* Please note that there might be a plural form mismatch for imported strings depending on the new source language. For example, some plural forms might not be displayed in the Editor, or some plural form translations might be used in other ones on translation export. We recommend updating the source files if the new source language has different plural forms than the initial one.
* If you had an opened browser tab with the Editor during the source language update, you might need to refresh it for changes to take effect and continue translating from the new source language.

## Target Languages

The **Target Languages** section allows you to add or remove target languages in your project, copy the target languages list from one project to another, and add custom languages.

You can update your target languages anytime. To add or remove target languages in your project, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Settings > Languages**.
  2. In the **Target Languages** section, you can make the following changes:
     * Select the languages you want to add to the project in the left panel.
     * Click on the languages you want to remove from the project in the right panel.
  3. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  If you need to temporarily remove some target languages from your project and later add them back, you won't lose your current translation progress for those target languages. The **translation progress will be restored** as soon as you add these languages back to the project.
</Aside>

### Copying Target Languages

If you translate multiple projects into the same target languages, you can copy the target languages list from one project to another in a few clicks:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Settings > Languages**.
  2. In the **Target Languages** section, click **Pre-fill** and select **Copy From Project…**.
  3. Select the project you'd like to copy target languages from and click **Choose**. <Image src={targetLanguagesCopying} alt="Copying Target Languages" />
  4. Click **Save**.

### Adding Custom Languages

If you'd like to translate your project into rare or less common target languages that are not officially supported at the moment, you can still add them as custom languages.

To add a custom language, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Settings > Languages**.
  2. In the **Target Languages** section, click **Custom Languages**. <Image src={customLanguageAdding} alt="Adding Custom Language" />

  4. Specify a language name.
  5. If your custom language is a dialect of any of the supported languages, select it from **The dialect of** drop-down menu.
  6. Fill in language code fields.
  7. Set the preferred text direction and plural forms options.
  8. Click **Save**. <Image src={customLanguageSaving} alt="Saving Custom Language" class="width-md" />
