In your project's **Settings > AI** section, you can configure and manage AI prompts and select a prompt to be used in the Editor. By default, the prompt to be used in the Editor is applied from the AI settings of the project owner's account. The AI prompts configured in the project settings will also be added to the list of AI prompts of the project owner's Crowdin account.

AI Prompt Types:

- Pre-Translate
- AI in Editor

Before the AI Prompts can be configured in the project settings, it's also necessary for the project owner to [configure the AI Providers](/crowdin-ai/#configuring-ai-providers).
