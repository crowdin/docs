In your project's **Settings > AI** section, you can configure and manage AI prompts and select prompts to be used in the Editor for features like AI Assistant and AI Suggestions.

By default, the prompts to be used in the Editor are applied from the AI settings of the project owner's account. If default AI settings in the project owner's account are not configured to apply automatically to all projects, it's necessary to select the appropriate AI prompts in the project's settings to activate the AI Assistant and AI Suggestions features. Otherwise, these features will remain inactive.

The AI prompts configured in the project settings will also be added to the list of AI prompts of the project owner's Crowdin account.

AI Prompt Types:

- Pre-Translate
- AI in Editor
- Custom type

Before the AI Prompts can be configured in the project settings, it's also necessary for the project owner to [configure the AI Providers](/crowdin-ai/#configuring-ai-providers).
