By default, Crowdin uses a predefined set of import and export parameters for each supported file format.

The Parser configuration feature lets you change the default import and export behavior predefined for file formats supported by Crowdin. Parser configuration in a specific project is applied only to files stored in this project.

You can set the parser configuration for all files of a certain format or single files. Once you save the parser configuration for some file format, you can upload source files to your project, and Crowdin will apply your settings accordingly.

You can configure import and export behavior for the following formats: Java Properties, Generic XML, DITA, AsciiDoc, Plain text, MadCap Flare, HTML, Office documents, Adobe FrameMaker, Adobe InDesign, Markdown, and MediaWiki.

## Parser Configuration Parameters

Some parameters are common to all formats, while others are format-specific. In the table below, you can see the available parser parameters and formats they could be configured for.

## Parser Configuration for All Project Files of a Specific Format

To set the preferred parser configuration for all files of a specific format, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Settings > Parser configuration**.
  2. Choose the needed file format and click Edit.
  3. Set the preferred settings.
  4. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

To add a new file format, click **Add Apps** and install the required format.

## Parser Configuration for a Single File

In some cases, you might need to set the parser configuration not for all files of some file format but just for a single file. To set the parser configuration for a single file, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Sources > Files**.
  2. Double-click on the needed file.
  3. In the appeared dialog, switch to the **Parser configuration** tab.
  4. Set the preferred settings.
  5. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

Once you save the file parser configuration, Crowdin will reimport this file and apply your settings.

## Post-processing Files with Nested Content

Sometimes, you might work with files that contain strings in a different format. A common example is a JSON file where some string values contain HTML content. The standard parser configuration isn't designed for these nested or cascading scenarios.

To properly process such files, you need to implement a custom Crowdin App that uses the File Post-Import Processing Module. This method, sometimes referred to as cascade processing, allows your app to intercept imported strings and instruct Crowdin to re-process specific ones using a different parser. For instance, you can tell Crowdin to parse a string from a JSON file as HTML, ensuring that HTML tags are correctly handled and not exposed to translators as plain text.

<Aside>
  This is an advanced approach that requires development resources to create a custom Crowdin App.
