The Parser configuration feature lets you change the default import and export behavior predefined for file formats supported by Crowdin. Parser configuration in a specific project is applied only to files stored in this project.

You can set the parser configuration for all files of a certain format or single files. Once you save the parser configuration for some file format, you can upload source files to your project, and Crowdin will apply your settings accordingly.

You can configure import and export behavior for the following formats: Java Properties, Generic XML, DITA, AsciiDoc, Plain text, MadCap Flare, HTML, Office documents, Adobe FrameMaker, Adobe InDesign, Markdown, and MediaWiki.

  4. Set the preferred settings.
  5. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

To add a new file format, click **Add Apps** and install the required format.

## Parser Configuration for a Single File

In some cases, you might need to set the parser configuration not for all files of some file format but just for a single file. To set the parser configuration for a single file, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Sources > Files**.
  2. Double-click on the needed file.
  3. In the appeared dialog, switch to the **Parser configuration** tab.

Once you save the file parser configuration, Crowdin will reimport this file and apply your settings.
