The project TM is automatically created for each project. Therefore, every approved or last added translation is automatically saved in the project TM.

* **Enable [Auto-Substitution](/translation-memory/)** &ndash; the feature substitutes the non-translatable elements (such as tags, HTML entities, placeholders, numbers, and more) in TM translation suggestions with the ones used in the source text. The feature improves the TM suggestions applied during pre-translation and those shown as translation suggestions in the Editor. Improved suggestions are included in the Translation Costs report, and improvable ones are included in the Costs Estimation report.
* **TM Suggestions for Dialects** &ndash; the feature allows you to display and use TM suggestions from the primary language for dialects if no dialect-specific suggestions are available.
* **Use global Translation Memory** &ndash; translators will have access to the Global Translation Memory, where all translations from the projects with this feature enabled are stored.
  <Aside>
    Once this option is enabled, translations made in this project will also be added to the Global Translation Memory, which anyone can access at Crowdin.
  </Aside>
* **TM Match Context Type** &ndash; the feature allows you to choose what should be considered as string context when suggesting Perfect (101%) match Translation Memory (TM) suggestions. You can choose between the following options:
  * Key and Context &ndash; when selected, the system considers both the key and context of strings for suggesting Perfect match TM suggestions. This mode is particularly useful for key-value file formats.
  * Auto &ndash; when selected, the system automatically applies the most suitable context consideration mode based on your file format.
  * Previous and next segment &ndash; when selected, the system considers the segments immediately preceding and following the current segment for context. Most applicable to HTML-based and other formats without a defined key-value structure.

## TM Pre-translate

In the **TM Pre-translate** section, you can enable and configure the automatic pre-translation via TM. When enabled, the system will automatically apply translations from your TM in the following cases: when there is newly uploaded content, when target languages change, or after file settings are modified.

You can configure the automatic pre-translation via TM using the following options:

* **Match Ratio** &ndash; select TM Match type of TM suggestions that should be applied during automatic pre-translation:
  * 100% Match
  * Perfect Match
* **Approve Added Translations** &ndash; select whether to approve new translations. Further configure it with the following options:
  * With perfect match &ndash; approves only Perfect match translations.
  * With perfect match (approved previously) &ndash; approve Perfect match translations that were previously approved.
  * All (skip auto-substituted suggestions) &ndash; approve all except auto-substituted translations.
  * All &ndash; approve all new translations added during the pre-translation.

Similar automatic pre-translation is also available via MT engines.

## Penalties

In the **Penalties** section, you can configure penalties that decrease the match percentage of TM suggestions based on specific conditions. This feature helps when you want to fine-tune the relevance of TM suggestions to your specific requirements.

You can configure the penalties using the following options:

* Auto-substitution Applied &ndash; penalize TM suggestions to which an auto-substitution was applied.
* Multiple Identical TM Matches &ndash; penalize TM suggestions where multiple identical TM matches are found.
* TM Priority Less Than &ndash; penalize TM suggestions that originate from a TM with a priority lower than a specified value. Besides a penalty value, you can also set the preferred TM priority threshold.
* TM Suggestion Last Modified More Than &ndash; penalize TM suggestions that were last modified more than a specified number of months ago. Besides a penalty value, you can also set the threshold in months.
* TM Suggestion Last Used More Than &ndash; penalize TM suggestions that were last used more than a specified number of months ago. Besides a penalty value, you can also set the threshold in months.
