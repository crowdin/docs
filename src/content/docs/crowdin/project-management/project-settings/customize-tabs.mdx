In the **Customize Tabs** section, you can manage the display of your project tabs, including their sorting order and visibility. This applies to both default project tabs and those from [Starred Apps and Starred Tools](/integrations/#starred-apps). This section only modifies how tabs appear in the project interface and does not disable or block the tabs themselves.

The configured order and visibility of project tabs are displayed to all project members.

## Reordering Project Tabs

To reorder the project tabs, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Settings > Customize Tabs**.
  2. Hover over <Icon name="material-symbols:drag-indicator" class="inline-icon" /> next to the tab you want to move, then click and drag it to the preferred position in the list.
</Steps>

## Toggling Tab Visibility

To hide or show project tabs, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Settings > Customize Tabs**.
  2. Clear the checkbox next to a tab's name to hide it, or select it to make it visible.

<Aside>
  - Hidden tabs are not displayed in the UI but can be accessed directly via their URLs. They will appear temporarily until the browser tab is refreshed.
  - **Dashboard** and **Settings** are primary project tabs that can't be hidden via the **Customize Tabs** section.
</Aside>

## Resetting Tab Settings

To reset the project tab order and visibility to their default settings, open your project and go to **Settings > Customize Tabs**, scroll down to the bottom of the list and click **Reset to defaults**.
