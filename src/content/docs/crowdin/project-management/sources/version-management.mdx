Maintain an agile localization process and prevent translation delays for added texts or new product features. Integrate your project branches with Crowdin and allow translators to access all new texts immediately.

When several people work on product development, branches help manage different content versions. If you have a continuous project, you can add project branches to Crowdin and allow translators to translate the texts in parallel with development to prevent deployment delays.

Branches in Crowdin look like regular folders marked with a specific icon and have special behavior for duplicate strings.

Example of branch structure in the version control system (VCS) and Crowdin:

## Managing Branches

You can create, clone, merge, rename, prioritize, or delete branches in Crowdin to streamline localization alongside development. Use the available UI options, API, or CLI depending on your workflow and project type.

### Creating Branches

You can create branches manually using the web interface (UI), automatically by connecting your project to a version control system, or by using CLI or API. The method you choose may depend on your project type or integration preferences.

#### Creating Branches via VCS Integration

Integrate Crowdin projects with [GitLab](/gitlab-integration/), [GitHub](/github-integration/), [Bitbucket](/bitbucket-integration/), or [Azure Repos](/azure-repos-integration/). When you select branches for localization in your VCS, they’ll be created automatically in Crowdin.

#### Creating Branches via Web Interface

To create branches via the web interface (UI), follow these steps:

<Tabs syncKey="projectType">
  <TabItem label="File-based project">
    <Steps>
      1. Open your project and go to **Sources > Files**.
      2. Click **New Version Branch**.
      3. In the appeared dialog, enter the branch name.
      4. In the **Duplicate Strings** section, select how duplicated strings should be handled.
      5. Click **Create** to finish.
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="String-based project">
    <Steps>
      1. Open your project and go to the **Branches** tab.
      2. Click **New Version Branch**.
      3. In the appeared dialog, enter the branch name.
      4. Select **Create empty branch** or **Clone existing branch**.
      5. If cloning, select the source branch from the dropdown that appears.
      6. Click **Create** to finish.
    </Steps>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

#### Branch Creation using API

You can use the Crowdin API to programmatically create branches. The available method depends on the project type:

* [Add Branch (File-based)](https://support.crowdin.com/developer/api/v2/#tag/Source-Files/operation/api.projects.branches.post)
* [Add Branch (String-based)](https://support.crowdin.com/developer/api/v2/string-based/#tag/Branches/operation/api.projects.branches.post)

#### Branch Management using CLI

With the Crowdin CLI, you can manage branches directly from your local environment, using the dedicated commands. You can also create a branch automatically during file upload.

### Cloning Branches

You can create a copy of an existing branch using the **New Version Branch** dialog or the **Clone** option in the context menu.

To clone a branch, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to the **Branches** tab.
  2. Do one of the following:
     - Click **New Version Branch**.
     - Hover over the needed branch, click <Icon name="mdi:dots-horizontal" class="inline-icon" /> (or right-click), and select **Clone**.
  3. In the appeared dialog, enter the name for the new branch.
  4. If cloning via **New Version Branch**, select **Clone existing branch** and choose the source branch from the dropdown.
  5. Click **Create** to finish.
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution" title="Limitations">
  Branch cloning is only available for [string-based](/creating-project/#string-based-project) projects.
</Aside>

### Merging Branches

You can merge one branch into another directly from the **Branches** tab using the context menu. During the merge process, Crowdin displays a summary of changes and allows you to select exactly which changes to accept before completing the merge.

<Steps>
  1. In the **Branches** tab, hover over the source branch you want to merge.
  2. Click <Icon name="mdi:dots-horizontal" class="inline-icon" /> (or right-click), and select **Merge**.
  3. In the appeared dialog, choose the target branch to merge into.
  4. Click **Continue** to proceed to the **Merge summary** page.
</Steps>

#### Understanding the Merge Summary

The **Merge summary** page displays a two-column comparison of all differences between the target branch (e.g., `main`) and the source branch (e.g., `dev`).

At the top, you'll see a summary: **You requested to merge `{source_branch}` into `{target_branch}`. Select the changes you accept before merging:**. The branch titles in this message are clickable links that open all strings for that specific branch in the Editor.

In the upper-right corner, next to the filter, you'll also see a high-level summary of the changes, with counters for:

* <Icon name="mdi:minus-box-outline" class="inline-icon text-red-700" /> **Deleted strings**
* <Icon name="mdi:plus-box-outline" class="inline-icon text-emerald-700" /> **Added strings**
* <Icon name="mdi:square-edit-outline" class="inline-icon text-blue-600" /> **Changed strings**
* <Icon name="mdi:alert-outline" class="inline-icon text-yellow-700" /> **Conflicted strings**

Key features of this page:

* **Selective Merging**: You must manually select each change (added, changed, or removed string) that you want to apply to the target branch. A counter (e.g., **1 of 4 selected**) in the upper-left corner tracks your selections.
* **Default Behavior**: If you do not select a change, the target branch's version will be preserved. For example, if you don't select a "String Added" row, that new string from the source branch will not be added to the target branch.
* **String Details**: Each string in the list displays its context, maximum length (if set), and a timestamp shows when that string was last modified.
* **Open in Editor**: Hover over a string to see the **Open in Editor** link, which opens that string in a new tab.

#### Filtering Changes

To filter the list to review specific types of changes, click <Icon name="mdi:filter-variant" class="inline-icon" /> In the upper-right corner and select the preferred filter option.

Available filter options:

* **All changes**: Shows all strings that are different between the branches.
* **Added strings**: Shows only strings that exist in the source branch but not the target.
* **Deleted strings**: Shows only strings that exist in the target branch but were removed in the source.
* **Changed strings**: Shows strings that were modified in the source branch.
* **Conflicted strings**: Shows strings that were modified in both the source and target branches, or strings that were deleted in the source but modified in the target (if the target's modification is newer). Conflicted strings are highlighted in yellow to call attention to them.

<Aside>
  If a string was changed in the target branch but remained unchanged in the source branch (since it was cloned), it will not appear in the merge summary. Crowdin considers the target branch's version to be the most up-to-date in this case, and it will be kept automatically.
</Aside>

#### Completing the Merge

Once you have selected all the changes you want to apply, you can finalize the merge.

At the bottom of the page, you'll find:

* **Delete \{source_branch} after merge** (Optional): Select this to automatically delete the source branch (e.g., `dev`) after its changes are successfully merged. This is useful for cleaning up temporary feature branches. Leave it unselected if you plan to continue working on the source branch.
* **Merge**: Click this to apply all selected changes to the target branch. This button remains disabled until you select at least one change (an added, changed, or deleted string) from the list.

Once the merge is complete, translations, approvals, and votes from both branches will be combined for the strings you selected.

<Aside type="caution" title="Limitations">
  Branch merging is only available for [string-based](/creating-project/#string-based-project) projects.
</Aside>

### Prioritizing Branches

You can set priorities to branches in file-based projects to help translators focus on the most important content first. Branches appear sorted by priority on the language page and in the Editor.

Available priorities:

- <Icon name="mdi:arrow-down-bold" class="inline-icon" /> – low
- <Icon name="mdi:arrow-up-bold-outline" class="inline-icon" /> – normal
- <Icon name="mdi:arrow-up-bold" class="inline-icon" /> – high

To set a priority for your branches, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Sources > Files**.
  2. Click the arrow icon next to the needed branch to set the preferred priority.
</Steps>

<Aside type="caution" title="Limitations">
  Branch prioritization is only available for [file-based](/creating-project/#file-based-project) projects.
</Aside>

### Other Actions from the Context Menu

In addition to cloning and merging, the context menu for each branch includes the following options:

* **Rename** – Allows you to change the name of the selected branch.
* **Add Task** – Opens the task creation dialog with the branch preselected.
* **Cost Estimate** – Opens the cost estimation dialog scoped to the branch.
* **Delete** – Permanently deletes the branch from the project. Use with caution.

## Duplicates

Because branches are different versions of the same product feature, their localization content is usually duplicated. To help translators translate versions consistently and avoid additional translation costs, Crowdin offers the **Show within a version branch** option, which hides duplicate strings between branches.

When this option is applied, only the original strings (usually from the master branch) need to be translated. All duplicates in other branches automatically receive translations from those originals.

<Tabs syncKey="projectType">
  <TabItem label="File-based project">
    In file-based projects, you can configure how duplicates are handled in **Settings > Import > Source Strings**. If your source files contain clear identifiers (keys), it's recommended to use the *Strict* version of the **Show within a version branch** option. Otherwise, the *Regular* option will work well for most use cases.
  <Image src={versionsDuplicateStrings} alt="Duplicates"/>
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="String-based project">
    In string-based projects, the **Show within a version branch (regular detection)** behavior is applied automatically and cannot be changed. This ensures translations are reused between branches without requiring any additional configuration.

## Suggested Workflow

To ensure smooth collaboration between developers and translators, version branches in Crowdin can be used in different ways depending on how you manage source content and what project type you're using.

### Managing Content Outside Crowdin

In both file-based and string-based projects, you can treat your external system (e.g., file storage or version control) as the source of truth. In this setup:

* Source files are managed and updated outside of Crowdin.
* You upload project content using the web interface (UI), API, CLI, or integrations.
* Selected branches are created in Crowdin accordingly.
* Translations are delivered back to your system once completed.

To implement this approach for your Crowdin project, we recommend the following workflow:

<Steps>
  1. Upload your project files to the Crowdin project using one of the [available methods](#creating-branches).
  2. In file-based projects, open your project and go to **Settings > Import > Source Strings**.
  3. Set the **Duplicate Strings** option to **Show within a version branch**.
</Steps>

The screenshot below visualizes how this workflow works in practice. All texts from *Master*, *Branch 1*, and *Branch 2* are transferred to the translation server immediately after they appear, even though the branches are not merged into the *Master* branch yet.

<Image src={branchesWorkflow} alt="Branches Workflow" class="no-shadow mb-8" />

### Managing Content in Crowdin (String-based Projects Only)

For string-based projects, you can also manage branches directly in Crowdin without relying on an external system to define structure or content updates. In this setup:

* Source content can be added the web interface (UI), API, CLI, or integrations.
* Version branches are created, cloned, and merged within Crowdin using the UI or API.
* Translations are optionally synced back to any connected integration, if used.

This approach gives more flexibility for teams who prefer to organize content and manage version flows entirely within Crowdin.

### Translation Download

Translations from all version branches are placed in one ZIP archive when downloaded through the web interface. Use the CLI or API to download the translations for each branch individually.

#### Translation Download using API

To download translations of the specific version branch with API, you can use the following API methods:

* [Build Project Translation](/developer/api/v2/#operation/api.projects.translations.builds.post) - make sure to use the `CrowdinTranslationCreateProjectBuildForm` schema.
* [Check Project Build Status](/developer/api/v2/#operation/api.projects.translations.builds.get).
* [Download Project Translations](/developer/api/v2/#operation/api.projects.translations.builds.download.download).

#### Translation Download using CLI

Download translations of the specific version branch:

```shell
crowdin download -b branch_name
```

### Merging Branches Outside Crowdin

The *Master* branch will contain new texts from the *Feature* branches as soon as they are merged. While synchronizing with Crowdin, texts in the *Master* branch are populated with translations from the appropriate branch.

After synchronizing the updated *Master* branch with Crowdin, you can remove the *Feature* branch from Crowdin. All translations stored in the *Master* branch will remain.

This approach is commonly used in file-based projects but can also apply to string-based ones if content is managed outside of Crowdin.

<Image src={branchMerging} alt="Merging Branches" class="no-shadow mb-8" />

### Branch Translation Verification

You can verify translations on production using only the *Feature* branch before changes are merged with your *Master* branch. Such test deployment allows you to quickly revert to the original Master branch version if needed.
