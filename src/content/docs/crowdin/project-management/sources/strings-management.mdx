You can view all the project's strings and manage strings settings via **Sources > Strings**.

### Changing Strings Visibility

If some strings contain data that is not supposed to be translated (e.g., placeholders, other technical entities), you can hide them from translators. To do this:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Sources > Strings**.

  2. Select the necessary strings.

  3. Click **Hide**.
</Steps>

### Filtering Strings

By default, all source strings of the project are displayed in **Sources > Strings**. If necessary, you can filter out strings using the available filter options (Issues: Show All, With Unresolved Issues, Without Unresolved Issues; Comments: Show All, With Comments, Without Comments; Screenshots: Show All, With Screenshots, Without Screenshots; Visibility: Show All, Hidden and Visible) and project labels.

### String Editing

You can add context to the string and set the max. length of the translation.
Once the translation limits are exceeded, the system notifies the contributor that translation should be shorter.

Some file formats allow editing (adding, deleting, and modifying) of the source texts and string identifiers directly in Crowdin so you can do the necessary corrections without updating the source file via **Sources > Files**. Check the full list below:

* [JSON](https://store.crowdin.com/json)

![String Editing](./_assets/string_edit.png)

To edit some particular word or phrase that appears in multiple source strings, you can use the **Find & Replace** feature in **Sources > Strings**.

:::note
When editing the identifier of a string contained in a group of strings (string array for Android XML, segments for XLIFF), the existing translations will be removed for all group strings but the edited one.

### Labels

Use labels in your project for an easy way to add context to the strings or organize them by certain topics. Labels are also useful while creating translation and proofreading tasks or searching for specific strings in the Editor with the help of [Advanced Filter](/crowdin/online-editor/overview/).

##### Add labels to the source strings in CSV and XLSX files using a dedicated column for labels

String labels added to the project with an initial CSV/XLSX file upload won't be overwritten or removed with subsequent file updates.
