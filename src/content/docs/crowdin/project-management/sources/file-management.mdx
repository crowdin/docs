You can manage all the project's files via **Sources > Files**. Here you can manually upload files for localization using various [supported formats](/supported-formats/).
When the files are uploaded, you'll be able to take a glance at how many *Strings* your files include and how many *Revisions* (changes) were done to each of them.

If you want to configure an automatic files' synchronization with your project, use the **Integrations** tab.

## Prioritizing Files

You can set a specific priority for each file by clicking an arrow icon next to the needed file. Then translators will be able to see files sorted according to their priority on the language page and in the Editor.

Files might have the following priorities:

- <Icon name="mdi:arrow-down-bold" class="inline-icon" /> – low
- <Icon name="mdi:arrow-up-bold-outline" class="inline-icon" /> – normal
- <Icon name="mdi:arrow-up-bold" class="inline-icon" /> – high

<Image src={filesPrioritizing} alt="Files Prioritizing" />

## File Settings

To access the configurations of specific files, right-click on the necessary file or click <Icon name="mdi:dots-horizontal" class="inline-icon" /> next to it and then select **Settings**. Alternatively, just double-click on the file.

<Image src={filesContextMenuSettings} alt="File Context Menu" />

### Title as it Appears to Translators

Show descriptive file titles to translators. For example: use *About Us Dialog* instead of *abt_us.xml*, or *In-app texts* instead of *Localizable.strings*.

<Aside type="caution">
  The file title is only shown in the Crowdin UI and doesn't rename the actual file.
</Aside>

### File Export

Define a file name or full path in the resulting archive, use the available placeholders to indicate the structure of exported content.

For example, you want the source file `Overview.csv` with Ukrainian translation to be named `Overview.ukrainian.csv` before integrating it with the application. In this case, you'd need to set the *Resulting file after translations export* to the following: `Overview.%language%.csv`.

By default, Crowdin adds [Crowdin language codes](/developer/language-codes/) during the file export. To use custom ones for specific languages in the whole project, set up [Language Mapping](/project-settings/languages/#adding-custom-language-codes).

<Image src={filesSettings} alt="Files settings" class="width-xl crowdin-modal" />

### Parser Configuration

Some file formats allow you to configure import and export behavior. In this case, file's Settings dialog will also contain the **Parser configuration** tab.

<Image src={filesParserConfiguration} alt="File Parser Configuration" class="width-xl crowdin-modal" />

### File Target Languages

By default, the source files are available for translation into all target languages of the project. Clear the checkboxes in the *File target languages* list next to the languages your file shouldn't be translated into, and click **Save**.

<Image src={filesFileTargetLanguages} alt="File Target Languages" class="width-xl crowdin-modal" />

### File Context

Add additional information or instructions to help translators better understand how to translate a file. File context can be added as plain text or Markdown in **File Settings > Context** or directly in the Editor. The provided context will be visible to translators in the Editor in the [File Context](/online-editor/#file-context) tab. The <Icon name="mdi:information" class="inline-icon" /> icon appears next to files that have file context added, helping you quickly identify which files include helpful notes for translators.

<Image src={filesFileContext} alt="File Context" class="width-xl crowdin-modal" />

<Aside type="caution" title="Limitations">
  File Context is only available for [file-based](/creating-project/#project-types) projects.
</Aside>

## Pre-translating Files and Folders

To quickly run pre-translation for one or more files or folders, right-click on the necessary item or click <Icon name="mdi:dots-horizontal" class="inline-icon" /> next to it and select **Pre-translate**.

## Renaming Files

To change the file's name, right-click on the necessary file or click <Icon name="mdi:dots-horizontal" class="inline-icon"/> next to it and select **Rename**.

<Image src={filesRename} alt="File Rename" />

## Cost Estimate

To estimate the cost of translation or proofreading for a specific file, right-click on the file and select **Cost Estimate**.

## Creating a Task

To create a task for a specific file, right-click on the file and select **Add task**. This allows you to assign translation or proofreading work for just that file to selected contributors or translation vendors.

<ReadMore>
  Read more about [Project Tasks](/tasks/).
</ReadMore>

## Opening in Editor

To open a file directly in the Editor, right-click on the file and select **Open in Editor**. This allows you to review translations and approvals, answer string comments, and more.

## Checking Progress

You can check the translation and approval progress for a branch, folder, or file you need. Right-click on the needed branch, folder or file, and select the **Progress**. To see how many words are translated and approved for each language, hover over the progress bar. To open the selected file in the Editor, click on the needed language.

To download translations for the chosen file, select the required languages, and click **Build & Download**. Optionally, you can select **Preserve folder hierarchy for export** to export translation files along with the folders they're stored in Crowdin.

<Image src={filesManagementProgresses} alt="File Progress" class="width-xl crowdin-modal" />

## Previewing Source Files

To preview the raw structure and content of a source file, right-click the file and select **Preview source**. This opens a read-only modal showing the file’s contents exactly as Crowdin received them.

## Downloading Source Files

To download a source file stored in your Crowdin project, right-click on the file and select **Download source**. This can be useful for reviewing the original content outside Crowdin, sharing it with teammates, or making offline edits before reuploading.

## Updating Source Files

If you have added new strings to a source file, you'll need to update the file in Crowdin to make the new content available to translators. To do this, click **Update** next to the needed file and select the new file from your machine.

<Image src={filesUpdating} alt="File Updating" />

If any source strings were modified in the updated file, Crowdin will display the **Keep Translations for Updated Strings** dialog. This dialog allows you to decide which existing translations to keep for the modified strings.

The dialog lists each modified string, displaying its **Key** (identifier) and allowing you to compare the **Current Strings** (original text) with the **New Strings** (updated text, with additions highlighted in green and deletions in red).

<Image src={filesUpdating2} alt="File Updating Options" class="width-xl" />

To keep the current translations for a modified string, select the checkbox next to it. For any string you don't select, its existing translations will be deleted after the file update.

Additionally, select the **Keep Approvals** option at the bottom of the dialog to preserve approvals for the translations you choose to keep.

Once you've made your selections, click **Update File**.

<Aside type="tip">
  Clicking on a string identifier in the **Key** column will open the string in the Editor, allowing you to review its full context, translation history, and other details before making a decision.
</Aside>

After the update is complete, Crowdin may indicate changes by displaying a blue dot next to the <Icon name="mdi:refresh" class="inline-icon" />**Refresh** button in the upper-right corner of the **Files** tab. Click this button to refresh the file list and display the most up-to-date information.

## Restoring Previous Versions

Each time you update the source file, a new revision is created. To restore your file to the previous revision, click the number on the needed file in the *Revision* column. In the appeared dialog, select the revision you want to restore your file to and click **Restore** next to it.

<Image src={filesRestore} alt="File Restoring" class="width-xl" />

## Branches and Folders

You can create folders and branches in **Sources > Files** with **New Folder** and **New Version Branch** buttons.

Folders represent your content structure, while branches help to manage different versions of the content.

Usually, branches in Crowdin are created automatically if you use GitHub, GitLab, or other VCS integration. Still, if you need to create branches manually, make sure to upload the master branch first, as all the others will be considered the feature branches.

Duplicates might be managed in **Settings > Import > Source Strings** by choosing the corresponding option for *Duplicate Strings*.

## Changing Scheme for CSV and XLSX Files

File formats like CSV and XLSX might require changing the initially configured scheme. Usually, it might be needed when you add a new target language to your Crowdin project.
