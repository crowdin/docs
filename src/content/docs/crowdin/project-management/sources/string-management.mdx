You can view all the project's strings and manage strings settings via **Sources > Strings**.

## Changing Strings Visibility

If some strings contain data that is not supposed to be translated (e.g., placeholders, other technical entities), you can hide them from translators. To do this:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Sources > Strings**.
  2. Select the necessary strings.
  3. Click **Hide**. <Image src={stringHide} alt="Changing visibility" />
</Steps>

## Filtering Strings

By default, all source strings of the project are displayed in **Sources > Strings**. If necessary, you can filter out strings using the available filter options (Issues: Show All, With Unresolved Issues, Without Unresolved Issues; Comments: Show All, With Comments, Without Comments; Screenshots: Show All, With Screenshots, Without Screenshots; Visibility: Show All, Hidden and Visible) and project labels.

<Image src={stringFilter} alt="Filter Strings" />

## String Editing

You can add context to the string, add or remove labels, set the max. length of the translation. Once the translation limits are exceeded, the system notifies the contributor that the translation should be shorter.

<Image src={stringEdit} alt="String Editing" class="width-lg" />

To edit some particular word or phrase that appears in multiple source strings, you can use the **Find & Replace** feature in **Sources > Strings**.

<Aside type="caution">
  When editing the identifier of a string contained in a group of strings (string array for Android XML, segments for XLIFF), the existing translations will be removed for all group strings but the edited one.
</Aside>

### Formats That Support Online Editing

Some file formats allow editing (adding, deleting, and modifying) of the source text and string identifiers directly in Crowdin, so you can make the necessary corrections without having to update the source file via **Sources > Files**.

The following file formats support editing the source text and string identifiers directly in Crowdin:

<Include file="editable-formats-list.mdx" />

### Labels

Use labels in your project for an easy way to add context to the strings or organize them by certain topics. Labels are also useful while creating translation and proofreading tasks or searching for specific strings in the Editor with the help of [Advanced Filter](/online-editor/#advanced-filter).

There are a few possible ways you can add labels to the strings.

##### Add labels to one string at a time via the *Edit String* dialog

<Steps>
  1. Click **Edit** on the string in the list.
  2. Select needed labels in the *Labels* field. <Image src={labelsAddingToOneString} alt="Add Labels" class="width-lg" />
  3. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

##### Add labels to multiple strings via the *Manage Strings Labels* dialog

<Steps>
  1. Select a few strings you want to add the same labels to.
  2. Click **Labels**.
  3. Select needed labels in the *Labels to be added* field. <Image src={labelsAddingToMultipleStrings} alt="Add Labels" class="width-lg" />
  4. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

##### Add labels to the source strings in CSV and XLSX files using a dedicated column for labels

<Aside>
  String labels added to the project with an initial CSV/XLSX file upload won't be overwritten or removed with subsequent file updates.
