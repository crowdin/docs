Crowdin integrates with top AI providers, including OpenAI, Google Gemini, Microsoft Azure OpenAI, and more, allowing you to leverage advanced AI-powered translations that consider additional context at different levels. These translations can be applied to your content with a few clicks using [pre-translation via AI](#pre-translation-via-ai). Additionally, AI in Crowdin can be used as an [assistant in the Editor](#using-ai-in-the-editor) for translation, proofreading, and more.

You can expand your AI provider options by installing respective applications from the Crowdin [Store](https://store.crowdin.com/tags/ai).

## Configuring AI

Crowdin AI integration provides powerful capabilities for enhancing localization workflows. Configuring AI involves [setting up providers](#configuring-ai-providers) and [creating prompts](#configuring-ai-prompts).

<Aside type="tip">
  Configure Crowdin AI in a few quick steps using the AI Quick Start Guide.
</Aside>

### Configuring AI Prompts

Prompt engineering is crucial for guiding AI in understanding context and providing accurate translations. Customizing prompts within Crowdin ensures that AI algorithms comprehend the nuances of your project, resulting in improved translation quality.

* **Contextual Prompts** &ndash; customize prompts to provide contextual information, such as project-specific terminology, style preferences, and target audience considerations. For example, include instructions on translating technical terms consistently or maintaining brand tone across languages.
* **Placeholder Utilization** &ndash; incorporate placeholders to dynamically insert context-specific information into prompts, enabling AI to generate translations aligned with project requirements.
* **File-Level Context** &ndash; use file-level context to provide instructions and contextual insights, enhancing AI's understanding of content nuances. Include file descriptions, summaries, or references to glossaries and style guides.

To configure AI prompts, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your profile and select **AI** on the left sidebar.
  2. In the **Prompts** tab, click <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" />**Add prompt**. If no prompts have been created yet, you can click **Create Default Prompts** to quickly set up pre-configured samples which can be customized to your personal preferences.
  3. In the appeared dialog, set the prompt parameters:
      * Select the prompt type (i.e., [Pre-translation & AI Suggestion](#pre-translation-via-ai), [AI Chat](#using-ai-in-the-editor), [QA check](#ai-qa-check), or Create custom type)
      * Custom type name (Specific to the custom prompt type)
      * Use this prompt as the default prompt for AI Suggestion in editor (Specific to Pre-translation & AI Suggestion prompt type)
      * Use this prompt as the default prompt for AI Assistant in editor (Specific to the AI Chat prompt type)
      * Title
      * Model (this also includes the AI Provider)
      * Advanced settings:
          * Visibility &ndash; Select projects where a prompt can be used:
              * All Projects &ndash; The prompt is available in all projects.
              * Selected Projects &ndash; The prompt is available only in the projects you select. If no projects are selected, or if all assigned projects are later deleted, the prompt will not be available in any project.
      * Prompt editor mode (i.e., Basic or Advanced)
      * Additional context (Basic mode) &ndash; specify which data will be included in the prompt using the following fields:
      <Aside>Context included by default: string context, string identifier (key), translation max. length.</Aside>

### Managing AI Prompts

Managing AI prompts in Crowdin involves various operations such as filtering and searching, editing, cloning, and deleting AI prompts. Below you can find instructions for each operation.

#### Viewing and Filtering AI Prompts

Once you open the **AI** page, you can view and search for prompts in the **Prompts** tab.

You can view the list of added prompts with the following details:

* **Name** – The name of the prompt.
* **Visibility** – Shows a counter of how many projects the prompt is available in with the list of projects (with clickable links).
* **Type** – The prompt's type (e.g., Pre-translation & AI Suggestion, AI Chat).
* **Model** – The AI model used by the prompt. A status indicator next to the model name shows if the prompt is ready to use:
    * A **green dot** indicates the prompt is configured correctly and ready for use.
    * A **red dot** indicates an issue with the prompt's configuration (e.g., the selected provider is disabled). Hover over the model name to see the specific error message.
* **Created** – The date the prompt was created.
* **Created by** – The user who created the prompt.
* **Last modified** – The date the prompt was last updated.
* **Modified by** – The user who last modified the prompt.
* **Last used by** – The user who last used the prompt.
* **Last used** – The date the prompt was last used.
* **Usage count** – The total number of times the prompt has been used.

<Aside type="tip">
  Some columns like **Created by**, **Last modified**, and **Usage count** are hidden by default. Click the column selector icon <Icon name="mdi:view-column" class="inline-icon" /> to choose which columns to display.
</Aside>

To find a specific prompt, use the **Search** field. To narrow down the list, click the **Filters** button, which allows you to filter by **Type**, **Created** date, **Created by** user, **Last modified** date, **Modified by** user, **Last used by** user, and **Last used** date.

<Image src={promptsList} alt="Prompts List" />

#### Editing AI Prompts

If you need to adjust your already configured prompt, you can simply edit it.

To edit AI prompts, follow these steps:

<Steps>

</Steps>

When editing a prompt, you'll find the **Prompt metadata** section. This information provides a clear audit trail for collaboration and troubleshooting. By tracking creation, modification, and usage data, you can understand which prompts are most effective, identify popular prompts for optimization, and manage costs more efficiently. The section contains the following read-only details:

* **Created by** – The user who created the prompt.
* **Created** – The date and time the prompt was created.
* **Modified by** – The user who last modified the prompt.
* **Last modified** – The date and time the prompt was last modified.
* **Last used by** – The user who last used the prompt.
* **Last used** – The date and time the prompt was last used.
* **Usage count** – The total number of requests made to the AI using this prompt.

Editing prompts allows you to update and improve them as needed to ensure they remain effective and aligned with your requirements. If you don't want to lose the current prompt configuration and are uncertain about the changes, consider [cloning](#cloning-ai-prompts) your prompt and experimenting with the copy.

#### Cloning AI Prompts

Cloning AI prompts allows you to experiment with and refine prompt configurations without altering the original. This feature is particularly useful for testing improved versions of prompts while preserving the initial setup.

<Aside type="tip">
  You can also [configure an automatic AI Pre-translate](/project-settings/pre-translate/#ai-pre-translate) for new content in your project.
</Aside>

## Using AI in the Editor

After configuring a prompt with the **AI Chat** type, Crowdin AI can be used in the Editor as an AI Assistant for translators and proofreaders. The AI Assistant works in a chat format, allowing you to send prompts and receive replies.

The AI Assistant is context-aware, meaning it automatically considers the string the translator is working on, the related glossaries, TM matches, the maximum acceptable length of the translation, the related screenshots, and more. This contextual awareness enables the AI Assistant to provide more accurate and relevant assistance.

Here are some tasks the AI Assistant can help with:

* **Correcting TM suggestions** - If you get a 60% match, the AI Assistant can improve the remaining 40%, ensuring consistency with your terminology and previous translations.
* **Serving as an advanced dictionary** - The AI Assistant can provide term definitions, translation variants, synonyms, and more.
* **Suggesting translations** - Similar to other MT tools, the AI Assistant can suggest translations that you can refine based on your specific needs or save as is.
* **Summarizing content** – For example, when translating knowledge base articles, it can generate short summaries to help you understand the content before translating.

To start using the AI Assistant, click the **AI Assistant** section in the right sidebar of the Editor.

You can also interact with the AI Assistant faster using context-aware shortcuts. When you hover over an AI, TM, or MT suggestion in the Context and Translations section, the **Discuss suggestion with AI** button appears. Click it to open the chat with the suggestion already prefilled.

To see what context is passed to the AI, click the <Icon name="mdi:information-outline" class="inline-icon" />**Show AI context** button in the AI Assistant panel header. This opens a modal that displays the full scope of context available to the AI, including the selected string, TM matches, glossary terms, file name, surrounding strings, filtered strings, project description, plural forms, and more.

<Image src={aiEditor} alt="AI Assistant in the Editor" />

For even faster and more efficient interaction with the AI Assistant, you can use prompt shortcuts. By default, three prompt shortcuts are available:

* Rephrase
* Shorten
* Translate all

To add your own prompt shortcuts, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Click <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-right corner to open the AI settings.
  2. Click <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" />**Add shortcut**.
  3. Specify a shortcut name and a prompt it will use.
  4. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

Additionally, in the **Editor Settings > AI** tab, you can create a custom prompt to provide the AI Assistant with a specific set of instructions that are sent each time you make a request. Note that the custom prompt is project-specific.

<Image src={aiEditorSettings} alt="AI Assistant Editor Settings" class="width-lg" />

When sending prompts to the AI Assistant, the instruction priorities are considered in the following order:

1. Instructions specified in the [**AI Chat** prompt settings](#configuring-ai-prompts).
2. Instructions specified in the custom prompt settings.
3. Instructions specified in the prompt shortcut or manually entered in the AI Assistant chat.

## AI QA Check

AI QA Check uses AI to automatically evaluate translations against defined quality standards. It helps translators quickly identify and resolve issues, ensuring accuracy, consistency, and compliance with project-specific requirements. AI QA Check complements and extends default QA Checks by providing comprehensive flexibility, reducing manual review efforts, and enhancing overall translation quality.

### How AI QA Check Works

When enabled, AI QA Check evaluates each submitted translation against a set of customizable evaluation criteria (Evaluation steps) defined in the configured QA Check prompt. Issues detected by the AI appear directly within the Editor as warnings, along with concise suggestions for corrections.

Evaluation steps may include:

* **Accuracy** – Ensuring no content is omitted, added, or incorrectly translated.
* **Fluency** – Checking grammar, spelling, punctuation, and readability.
* **Terminology** – Confirming consistent and correct use of project-specific terms.
* **Style** – Verifying translations align with defined stylistic guidelines.
* **Design** – Ensuring translations fit design constraints, including length and markup.
* **Locale Convention** – Adapting formats for dates, currencies, addresses, and more.
* **Cultural Adaptation (Verity)** – Localizing culture-specific references appropriately.
* **General Issues** – Identifying other miscellaneous quality issues.

For example, if a translation deviates from established glossary terms or fails to meet local formatting standards, the AI will highlight this and offer recommendations, guiding translators to achieve compliance and consistency.

### Setting Up AI QA Check

To use AI QA Check, create and configure a [QA Check prompt](#configuring-ai-prompts). Each QA Check prompt contains clearly defined evaluation steps the AI follows to detect translation issues. Unlike other AI prompts, the QA Check prompt includes a dedicated **Evaluation steps** section, allowing you to customize, edit, or expand upon predefined checks.

You can also enhance the accuracy of the AI’s analysis by including various types of additional context relevant to your project's content.

After configuration, you can assign a QA Check prompt as the default for either your entire organization or individual projects.

### Applying AI QA Check in Projects

To enable AI QA Check in your projects, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. [Create and enable a QA Check prompt](#configuring-ai-prompts).
  2. Set it as the default QA prompt in the project's **Settings > AI > Settings**.
  3. Enable the **AI-powered check** in the project's **Settings > QA Checks**.
</Steps>

Once set, the AI continuously checks submitted translations, ensuring consistent compliance with your project's quality guidelines.
