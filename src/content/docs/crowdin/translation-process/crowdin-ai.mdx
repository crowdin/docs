Crowdin integrates with top AI providers, including OpenAI, Google Gemini, Microsoft Azure OpenAI, and more, allowing you to leverage advanced AI-powered translations that consider additional context at different levels. These translations can be applied to your content with a few clicks using [pre-translation via AI](#pre-translation-via-ai). Additionally, AI in Crowdin can be used as an [assistant in the Editor](#using-ai-in-the-editor) for translation, proofreading, and more.

You can expand your AI provider options by installing respective applications from the Crowdin [Store](https://store.crowdin.com/tags/ai).

## Configuring AI

Crowdin AI integration provides powerful capabilities for enhancing localization workflows. Configuring AI involves [setting up providers](#configuring-ai-providers) and [creating prompts](#configuring-ai-prompts).

### Configuring AI Prompts

Prompt engineering is crucial for guiding AI in understanding context and providing accurate translations. Customizing prompts within Crowdin ensures that AI algorithms comprehend the nuances of your project, resulting in improved translation quality.

* **Contextual Prompts** &ndash; customize prompts to provide contextual information, such as project-specific terminology, style preferences, and target audience considerations. For example, include instructions on translating technical terms consistently or maintaining brand tone across languages.
* **Placeholder Utilization** &ndash; incorporate placeholders to dynamically insert context-specific information into prompts, enabling AI to generate translations aligned with project requirements.
* **File-Level Context** &ndash; use file-level context to provide instructions and contextual insights, enhancing AI's understanding of content nuances. Include file descriptions, summaries, or references to glossaries and style guides.

To configure AI prompts, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your profile and select **AI** on the left sidebar.
  2. In the **Prompts** tab, click **Add prompt**. Alternatively, you can go ahead with creating prompt samples clicking **Try a sample**. Crowdin allows you to quickly set up pre-configured prompts that are ready to perform effectively from the moment they are created. While these samples are designed to work good initially, you can customize them to your personal preferences.
  3. In the appeared dialog, set the prompt parameters:
      * Select **Enabled**
      * Select the prompt type (i.e., Pre-translate or AI in editor)
      * Title
      * AI Provider
      * AI Model
      * Use this prompt as the default prompt for AI in editor (Specific to the AI in editor prompt type)
      * Mode (i.e., Basic or Advanced)
      * Additional context (Basic mode) &ndash; specify which data will be included in the prompt using the following fields:
          * Company description
          * Project description
          * Audience description
          * String context
          * String identifier (key)
          * Translation max. length
          * Other languages translations &ndash; select specific language tranlations to be considered by AI as additional context or leave this field as is to use translations from all languages.
          * Glossary terms &ndash; allows AI to consider domain glossary terms.
          * TM suggestions &ndash; allows AI to consider TM suggestions.
          * File content &ndash; allows AI to consider a whole file as the context for translating a segment of strings, improving translation accuracy for text documents. Although, when using file content as an additional context it can lead to increased token usage, potentially resulting in additional costs.
          * File context &ndash; allows AI to consider a textual description of the file added in the file settings. <ReadMore>Read more about [File context](/file-management/#file-context).</ReadMore>
          * Screenshots &ndash; allows AI to consider a visual context in the form of screenshots where the strings are tagged. This enhances accuracy and context awareness. <ReadMore>Read more about [Screenshots](/screenshots).</ReadMore>
          * Public project description &ndash; allows AI to consider public project description.  
          <Image src={configuringPromptBasic} alt="Configuring AI Prompt (Basic Mode)" />
      * Advanced mode &ndash; click **Advanced mode** to compose your prompt in the most precise way. While composing your prompt in the Advanced mode, you can increase translation quality by leveraging context information in your prompts using the following placeholders:
          * `%sourceLanguage%` &ndash; The source language of a project.
          * `%targetLanguage%` &ndash; The target languages a project is translated into.
          * `%json%` &ndash; A collection of strings from the current segment, including the string identifier (key), context, text, maximum length, and translations to other languages (if the translations placeholder is specified).
          * `%fileName%` &ndash; The file name of the current segment.
          * `%fileContext%` &ndash; The file context of the current segment (can be provided via the file settings modal in the 'Files' tab).
          * `%fileContent%` &ndash; The source file content of the current segment.
          * `%tm%` &ndash; Translation Memory (TM) matches relevant to the current segment.
          * `%terms%` &ndash; All the glossary terms relevant to the current segment.
          * `%fileTranslations%` &ndash; Translations of the current segment into the specified language.
          * `%projectName%` &ndash; Crowdin project name.
          * `%projectPublicDescription%` &ndash; Project public description.  
          <Image src={configuringPromptAdvanced} alt="Configuring AI Prompt (Advanced Mode)" />
      * Visibility &ndash; select specific projects where a prompt can be used or leave this field as is to allow a prompt usage across all projects.

</Aside>

## Using AI in the Editor

After configuring a prompt with the **AI in editor** type, Crowdin AI can be used in the Editor as an AI Assistant for translators and proofreaders. This AI Assistant can be communicated with in a chat format, allowing you to send prompts and receive replies.

The AI Assistant is context-aware, meaning it knows the string the translator is working on, the related glossaries, TM matches, the maximum acceptable length of the translation, the related screenshots, etc. This contextual awareness enables the AI Assistant to provide more accurate and relevant assistance.

Here are some tasks the AI Assistant can help with:

* Correcting TM suggestions: If you get a 60% match, the AI Assistant can improve the remaining 40%, ensuring consistency with your terminology and previous translations.
* Serving as an advanced dictionary: The AI Assistant can provide term definitions, translation variants, synonyms, and more.
* Suggesting translations: Similar to other MT tools, the AI Assistant can suggest translations which you can further refine based on your specific needs or save as is.

In addition, the AI Assistant can help in translating knowledge base articles by providing short summaries, helping you grasp the content quickly before translating. 

When working in the Editor, you can start using the AI Assistant by clicking the AI Assistant tab in the right sidebar.

<Image src={aiEditor} alt="AI Assistant in the Editor" />

For faster and more efficient interaction with the AI Assistant, you can use prompt shortcuts. By default, there are three prompt shortcuts available:

* Rephrase
* Shorten
* Translate all

To add your own prompt shortcuts, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Click <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon"/> in the upper-right corner to open the AI settings.
  2. Click <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon"/> **Add shortcut**.
  3. Specify a shortcut name and a prompt it will be using.
  4. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

Additionally, in the **Editor Settings > AI** tab, you can create a custom prompt to provide the AI Assistant with a specific set of instructions that are sent each time you make a request. Note that the custom prompt is project-specific.

<Image src={aiEditorSettings} alt="AI Assistant Editor Settings" width="500" />

When sending prompts to the AI Assistant, the instruction priorities are considered in the following order:

1. Instructions specified in the [**AI in editor** prompt settings](#configuring-ai-prompts).
2. Instructions specified in the custom prompt settings.
3. Instructions specified in the prompt shortcut or manually entered in the AI Assistant chat.
