Crowdin provides localization services as a [Crowdin Language Services](/crowdin-language-services/) vendor and cooperates with several other professional translation agencies that offer such services to Crowdin customers.

<Image src={vendorsList} alt="Vendors list" class="no-shadow mb-8" />

Some of them, like BLEND and Gengo are integrated with Crowdin via API, so the translation ordering becomes fully automated. When you purchase translations from them, Crowdin forwards your untranslated data directly to the agency. After the translations are completed, they're uploaded back to your Crowdin project, where you can download them to your machine.

By selecting any other vendor from the list, you'll contact a real person who can be assigned to a project as a proofreader or project manager.
They will manage the process for you: involve the translators, maintain the quality, monitor the progress, and meet the deadlines.

Professional translation is a paid service where the approximate cost for your project is calculated or negotiated during the purchasing process.

## Automated Translations Ordering

You can order the translation from BLEND and Gengo in a few clicks. See the detailed instructions below.

### Connecting BLEND and Gengo with Crowdin

Before you can order translations from BLEND and Gengo, you need to have a Customer account on their platforms and sufficient balance.

Register at [BLEND](https://app.getblend.com/auth/register) and [Gengo](https://gengo.com/auth/form/signup/) if you don't already have an account.

To establish the connection between your customer account and your Crowdin account, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Log in to Crowdin.
  2. On your profile home page, open **Vendors**.
  3. Select **BLEND** or **Gengo**.
  4. Click **Connect Account**. <Image src={blendConnect} alt="Connect BLEND" />
  5. Enter *Public Key* and *Secret Key* from the BLEND [API keys](https://app.getblend.com/profile/#apikeys) tab or the Gengo [API settings](https://gengo.com/account/api_settings/). Click **Submit Keys**.
</Steps>

### Creating Translation Tasks

To send the localization content to BLEND or Gengo, you need to create tasks in the Crowdin project. Follow these step-by-step instructions for task creation:

<Steps>
  1. Click **Create Task** using the project's **Tasks** tab or straight from the vendor page via **Vendors** being logged in as a project owner. Ensure to select the project from the drop-down list when creating a task via **Vendors**. <Image src={blendCreateTask} alt="Create Task" />
      <Aside>Project managers can create tasks for vendors only using the project's [Tasks](/tasks/) tab.</Aside>
  2. Set the [task parameters](#task-parameters).
  3. Click **Create Task** to complete the translation order.
</Steps>

### Translation Process

When the task is created, it’s automatically sent to the selected vendor. As soon as translation starts, the related task in Crowdin will automatically change the status to *In Progress*. And when the translations are finished, the task will gain the *Done* status in Crowdin.
