Project files can be downloaded for offline translation. Translators will be able to download files only if the project manager enables downloads in the [Project Settings](/project-settings/).

## Downloading Files

You can download each file separately (in original or XLIFF format), download filtered strings (in XLIFF format), or download all files for a specific language (in original or XLIFF format). It could be done via the Editor or the language page.

### Downloading a Single File via Editor

To download a single file to translate offline, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open the necessary file in the Editor.
  2. Click on the Main menu <Icon name="mdi:menu" class="inline-icon"/> in the upper-left corner.
  3. In the *File* menu, select **Download** or **Export in XLIFF**. <Image src={downloadFiles3} alt="Download File" />
</Steps>

### Downloading a Single File via Language Page

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and select a language.
  2. Click <Icon name="mdi:dots-horizontal" class="inline-icon"/> toward the file that should be downloaded.
  3. Select **Download** or **Export in XLIFF**. <Image src={downloadFiles2} alt="Download File" />
</Steps>

### Downloading All Files for a Specific Language

To download all the project files for a specific language, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and select a language.
  2. Click <Icon name="heroicons:arrows-up-down-solid" class="inline-icon"/>.
  3. Select **Download translations** or **Export in XLIFF**. <Image src={downloadFiles} alt="Download All Files" />
</Steps>

Using the *Download translations* option, you will get a ZIP archive with all the project files containing translations in an original format. The *Download* option is useful in case you want to test the product's localized version.

Using *Export in XLIFF*, you will get all the source strings and completed translations in a single XLIFF file. This way is more convenient, as it doesn't require opening each file separately to translate. XLIFF files are supported by the majority of desktop localization tools.

### Downloading Filtered Strings in XLIFF

There are cases when it's necessary to download strings based on some specific criteria. For example, you might want to download strings translated by some specific project member, or only untranslated strings, or only strings with comments.

To download filtered strings, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open the necessary file in the Editor.
  2. Filter strings based on some specific criteria.
  3. Click on the Main menu <Icon name="mdi:menu" class="inline-icon"/> in the upper-left corner.
  4. In the *File* menu, select **Export Filtered in XLIFF**. <Image src={downloadFilesExportFiltered} alt="Download Filtered Strings" />
</Steps>

## Common Questions

**My XLIFF file was translated offline. Now It contains finished translations, but when I try to upload it back to Crowdin, the translations are not displayed in the project. What might be the reason?**

According to the official documentation, `<target>` elements in the XLIFF file contain the `state` attribute that indicates the current translation state for each string.

When you export XLIFF files from Crowdin for offline translation, each of the `<target>` nodes will contain a `state` attribute with the respectful value. Below you can see the possible values:

- `needs-translation` – the segment needs translation.
- `translated` – the segment was translated.
- `final` – the segment was translated and approved.

Usually, offline CAT tools that support the XLIFF file format automatically change the state for each string on export.

Though, if your CAT tool doesn't change the `state` attribute for translated strings automatically or translations are done manually in the Notepad, it would be necessary to manually change the `state` attribute in your XLIFF file to the `translated` or `final` value to be sure that translations will be successfully uploaded to Crowdin.
