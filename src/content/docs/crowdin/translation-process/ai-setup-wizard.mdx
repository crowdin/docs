The AI Setup Wizard simplifies and speeds up the configuration of Crowdin AI, allowing you to leverage AI-powered translations that adapt to various levels of context. With just a few steps, you can enable AI Pre-translate to apply these translations to your content or use AI as an assistant in the Editor for translation, proofreading, and more.

Designed to get you started quickly, the wizard guides you through selecting needed features, configuring providers, and automatically creating AI prompts for the selected features.

## When to Use the AI Setup Wizard

You’ll see a **Start Using Crowdin AI Right Now!** banner if you haven’t configured your prompts yet. Click the **AI Setup Wizard** button to begin configuring Crowdin AI.

## Selecting AI Features

On the **Features** step, select the AI functionalities you'd like to enable in your Crowdin projects:

* **AI Pre-translate** &ndash; Automatically pre-translate strings with contextual awareness.
* **AI in Editor** &ndash; Provides translators with AI-powered assistance.
  * *Show AI Suggestions:* Displays AI suggestions along with TM and MT suggestions.
    <Aside type="caution">
      Enabling AI suggestions may increase token usage, depending on your provider.
    </Aside>

Once you select the needed features, Crowdin will create AI prompts for them. You can adjust these prompts later in the **AI > Prompts** settings if needed.

## Configuring AI Providers

On the **Provider Setup** step, choose an AI provider and configure the credentials:

<Steps>
  1. Select a provider from the **AI Provider** drop-down menu.
  2. Click <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" /> to explore and add more providers from the [Crowdin Store](https://store.crowdin.com/) if needed.
  3. Choose how to manage your credentials:
     * **I have my own API key** &ndash; Recommended for enhanced privacy and ownership.
     * **Managed by Crowdin** &ndash; Ideal for testing or smaller volumes.
        <Aside>This option requires a sufficient [account balance](/crowdin-managed-services/#adding-funds-to-account-balance). You can add funds during setup or manage your balance later in **Account Settings > Billing > Crowdin Managed Services**.</Aside>
</Steps>

After selecting and configuring your provider, click **Continue** to proceed to the final step.

### Add Context for Better Translations

AI performs best when provided with sufficient contextual information. Crowdin supports multiple levels of context to improve translation accuracy:

* **String level** &ndash; Includes terminology, context, and TM data.
* **File level** &ndash; Includes descriptions, file names, and the file's overall context.
* **Project level** &ndash; Includes a high-level description of the ongoing project.

## Best Practices for Setting Up Crowdin AI

Follow these best practices to optimize your Crowdin AI setup and ensure smooth operation:

* **Adjust Settings to Your Needs** &ndash; You can revisit the AI settings anytime to enable or disable features, switch providers, or modify prompts.
* **Monitor Usage and Costs** &ndash; If using a managed AI service, track your balance and billing to avoid disruptions. <ReadMore>Read more about [Using Crowdin Managed Services](/crowdin-managed-services/#using-crowdin-managed-services).</ReadMore>
* **Enhance Security** &ndash; For better control over data privacy and ownership, consider using your own API key.
