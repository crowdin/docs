Integrate your Crowdin projects with the BLEND agency and allow BLEND translators to work with translation files in Crowdin Editor.

The integration provides:

- Instant synchronization of localization content from Crowdin to BLEND using Crowdin tasks.
- Possibility for BLEND translators to easily access and work in Crowdin Editor.
- 2-way synchronization of comments between BLEND and Crowdin.

## Connecting BLEND with Crowdin

You need to have a client account in BLEND to enable integration and sufficient Credit Balance so you can use BLEND translation services. Register at [BLEND](https://app.getblend.com/auth/register) if you don't have an account yet.

Follow these steps to establish the connection:

<Steps>
  1. Log in to Crowdin.
  1. Open your profile home page and select **Vendors** on the left sidebar.
  1. Click **View all vendors** and select **BLEND**.
  1. Click **Connect Account**. <Image src={blendConnect} alt="Connect BLEND" />
  1. Enter *Public Key* and *Secret Key* from the BLEND [API keys](https://app.getblend.com/profile/#apikeys) tab. Click **Submit Keys**.
</Steps>

## Creating Tasks for Content Synchronization

To send the localization content to BLEND, you need to create tasks in the Crowdin project. Follow these step-by-step instructions for task creation:

<Steps>
  1. Click **Create Task** using the **Tasks** tab on the project home page or straight from the vendor page via **Vendors**. Ensure to select the project from the drop-down list when creating a task via **Vendors**.
      <Image src={blendCreateTask} alt="Create Task" />
      <Aside>Project managers can create tasks for vendors only using the project's [Tasks](/tasks/) tab.</Aside>
  2. Set the task parameters:
      * *Title* &ndash; specify the name of the task that will be visible to BLEND translators.
      * *Description* (optional) &ndash; add any additional details that may be helpful for BLEND translators.
      * *Type* &ndash; select either *Translate by vendor* or *Proofread by vendor*.
      * *Translation Vendor* &ndash; select *BLEND* from the list.
      * *Expertise* &ndash; select the required subject matter expertise (e.g., Standard, Technical, etc.).
      * *Include edit service* (only for Translate by vendor) &ndash; adds an Editing project on the BLEND side for an additional linguistic review.
      * *Preceding task* (only for Proofread by vendor) &ndash; link the task to a previously created translation task to inherit its scope and language settings.
      * *Skip strings already included in other tasks* &ndash; skip strings that are already assigned to other tasks.
      * *Create Cost Estimate Report* &ndash; automatically generate a cost estimate based on selected content and the rates template.
        * *Rates template* &ndash; select the template to be used for calculating the estimate.
      * *String filters* &ndash; filter which strings should be included in the task:
        * *Strings* &ndash; select whether to include all untranslated strings or not approved strings, or only those modified within a specific period.
        * *Filter by labels* (optional) &ndash; select one or more labels to include only strings with the specified labels. Then, select the match rule:
          * *All selected labels* &ndash; includes only strings that have all selected labels (AND logic).
          * *Any selected label* &ndash; includes strings that have at least one of the selected labels (OR logic).
        * *Exclude by labels* (optional) &ndash; select one or more labels to exclude strings with the specified labels. Then, select the match rule:
          * *All selected labels* &ndash; excludes only strings that have all selected labels (AND logic).
          * *Any selected label* &ndash; excludes strings that have at least one of the selected labels (OR logic).
        * *Include pre-translated strings only* (only for Proofread by vendor) &ndash; include only strings that were previously pre-translated.
      * *Files* (for file-based projects) or *Branches* (for string-based projects) &ndash; select content to include in the task.
      * *Languages* &ndash; select target languages (a separate task will be created for each selected language).
  3. Click **Create Task** for project files to be sent to BLEND.

<Aside type="caution">
  In case you change the task's name or description or update the files selected for the existing task, it won’t be re-synchronized with BLEND.
</Aside>

## Translation and Proofreading Process

When the task is created, it’s automatically sent to BLEND and visible to BLEND translators/proofreaders in the *Open Projects* tab. BLEND translator/proofreader will need to **Start Project** and then use the **Open Workbench** button to access Crowdin Editor.

</ReadMore>

A translator/proofreader will be logged in Crowdin with BLEND profile data to work on content localization. When the work starts, the related task in Crowdin will automatically move to the *In Progress* status. And when the work is finished (project marked as Completed on the BLEND side), the task will gain *Done* status in Crowdin.

## Discussions and Comments

If you need to add some details to an already created task, you can add *Comments*.

<Image src={blendTaskComments} alt="Task Comments" />

Comments are synchronized with BLEND so that a translator can see them in the *Customer Discussion* section and reply if needed. Translator messages left in the *Customer Discussion* section in the BLEND project are also automatically sent to Crowdin and shown in the *Comments* section inside the Crowdin task.

## Managing BLEND Integration

Access integration by opening **Vendors**, select **BLEND**. You can **Switch Account** or **Disconnect Account** if necessary.

<Aside>
  Only the project owner can connect, switch and disconnect the BLEND account. If you disable BLEND integration or switch to another BLEND account, the existing tasks (if any) will remain synchronized.
