The Tasks is one of the essential tools for managing the localization process in Crowdin. As a contributor (translator or proofreader), you can view and manage your assigned tasks, track progress, access content assigned within the task, and communicate with project managers or other contributors.

## Task Notifications

To stay informed about new task notifications and the latest task updates, enable the Task event type in your account's Notifications settings.

You'll receive notifications about any updates or changes to your tasks. These might include:

- A task being assigned to you.
- A task deleted.
- Changes to task details like due dates, content, or status.
- Mentions and comments related to the task.

There are four channels through which you can receive notifications. You can enable the ones that work best for you and disable unnecessary ones.

### Viewing and Filtering Assigned Tasks

To view and filter all tasks assigned to you, open your profile and select **To Do** on the left sidebar

You can view your tasks in the following two sections:

* *All* &ndash; all the tasks assigned to you.
* *Archived* &ndash; the tasks you archived.

<Aside>
  If you archive a task assigned to several users, it will be shown on the *Archived* section for you and remain on the *All* section for the other users.
</Aside>

On the **To Do** page, you can view tasks with the following details:

* ID &ndash; the unique identifier for the task.
* Name &ndash; the title of the task.
* Task type label &ndash; indicates whether the task is for translation or proofreading.
* Status &ndash; the current status of the task.
* Project name &ndash; indicates the project in which the task is created.
* Target language &ndash; the target language involved in the task.
* Words left &ndash; the number of words left to be translated or proofread.
* Due date &ndash; the deadline for task completion, if specified by the project manager.

By default, all tasks are displayed on the **To Do** page. To filter the tasks displayed, click <Icon name="mdi:filter-variant" class="inline-icon" /> and use the available filter options:

* Projects: All, specific projects.
* Status: All statuses, To Do, In Progress, Done, Closed, Pending
* Languages: All languages, specific language.
* Due date: All, Overdue now, Custom range.
* Type: All types, Translate by own translators, Proofread by own proofreaders, Translate by vendor, Proofread by vendor.

To search for a particular task, type its name in the **Search tasks** field.

To sort tasks, click **Sort by** and select one of the available options:

* ID
* Created at
* Resolved at
* Due date

### Viewing Task Details

Before starting your work on a task, you can review task details to understand its scope.

To view task details, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Go to your **Workspace** and select **Tasks** on the left sidebar.
  1. Click on the task you want to view.  
</Steps>

The task will open directly within the project it's associated with. Alternatively, you can access your assigned tasks by navigating to the specific project's **Tasks** tab and selecting yourself using the **Assignee** filter parameter.

<Aside type="tip">
  The tasks assigned to you are marked with <Icon name="mdi:star" class="inline-icon" /> next to the task name.
</Aside>

Click on any task in your list to view its details. In addition to the details available when [viewing all of your assigned tasks](#viewing-and-filtering-assigned-tasks), you will also see these details:

* Created by &ndash; the user who created the task.
* Created and modified dates &ndash; when the task was created and modified.
* Started and resolved dates &ndash; timestamps indicating when you started and completed the task.
* Files &ndash; files associated with the task.
* Members &ndash; details like the number of words assigned to and remaining for each member.

You can also open the task in the Editor by clicking **Translate** or **Proofread**, depending on the task type.

If you prefer to work offline, click <Icon name="mdi:cloud-upload" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-right corner and select **Export in XLIFF**. When you are finished translating, use **Upload XLIFF translations** to upload your translations.

### Starting and Working on Your Tasks

Once you're ready to start working on a task:

<Steps>
  1. Click on the task to open it.
  1. Review the strings or files assigned to you.
  1. Click **Translate** or **Proofread** to start translating or proofreading as needed.
</Steps>

As you work on the task, change its status from **To Do** to **In Progress**. Once your work is complete, update the status to **Done**.

## Discussions and Comments

If you encounter issues or need assistance with your assigned task, leave a comment in the task for project managers or other contributors to see and respond.

## Splitting Tasks

If a large task needs to be divided among multiple contributors, your project manager may split the content. You'll receive only a portion of the task to work on. Focus on completing your assigned section and mark it as done when finished.

## Sequential Tasks

In some cases, tasks may be part of a sequence where one needs to be completed before the next can begin. For example:

- You may complete a translation task, after which a proofreading task becomes available.
- If you're assigned a proofreading task linked to a translation task, it will remain pending until the translation is finished.

Sequential tasks help streamline the process, ensuring that each step is completed in the correct order.

## Q&A

<QuestionAnswer title="How do I know when a task is due?">
  The task due date (if specified by the project manager) is displayed on the task in your **Tasks** tab and its details section. You can also filter tasks by the due date in your **Tasks** tab to prioritize your work.
</QuestionAnswer>
<QuestionAnswer title="What should I do if I finish a task early?">
  Mark the task as **Done** in your task list. If the task is part of a sequence, this will trigger the next task (e.g., proofreading) to begin.
