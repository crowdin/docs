To view all the tasks assigned to you, open your profile and select **To Do** on the left sidebar.

You can view your tasks in the following two sections:

* *All* &ndash; all the tasks assigned to you.
* *Archived* &ndash; the tasks you archived.

<Image src={tasksUserPage} alt="User Tasks" />

<Aside>
  If you archive a task assigned to several users, it will be shown on the *Archived* section for you and remain on the <i>All</i> section for the other users.
