## Payment Options for Crowdin Language Services

When ordering translation or proofreading, you can choose from the following payment options.

### Post Payment

This option allows you to pay for tasks after they are completed. If you select **Post Payment**, payments will be processed by the vendor (i.e., Alconost Inc.). This option is only available if the total value of the tasks to be created is $3000 or more.

### Managed by Crowdin Balance

With this option, you can use your dedicated Crowdin Managed Services balance to pay for translation or proofreading tasks. Crowdin Managed Services allows you to manage various localization resources and expenses from one central balance, simplifying your workflow. You can easily add funds to this balance and track your usage, ensuring easy access to translation vendors, machine translation engines, and AI models without creating separate accounts. To activate this option, ensure you have sufficient funds in your Crowdin Managed Services balance when creating tasks.

## Task Status

To track the localization progress of the created tasks, follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. Open your project and go to the **Tasks** tab.
1. Click on the task's name to open it.
1. In the **Details** section, you can see the Vendor Project Status:
    * Waiting for payment &ndash; the localization services weren't paid
    * Payment in process &ndash; the payment is being processed by the Fastspring (Crowdin's payment processing partner)
    * In progress &ndash; the payment is processed, and the Crowdin Language Services representatives are working on the task
    * Completed &ndash; The work on the task was completed in full
</Steps>

## Translation and Proofreading Process

Once the payment is processed, the Crowdin Language Services manager will receive a notification about new tasks and will be added to your project members to manage the localization process.
Crowdin Language Services translators work directly in Crowdin Editor, so all the context information (e.g., [Screenshots](/screenshots/), [Labels](/project-settings/labels/), etc.) you added to the source files will be accessible to them as well.

A translator will be logged in to Crowdin with Crowdin Language Services profile to work on content localization. So in your Crowdin project, you will see translation activities made by the Crowdin Language Services profile. When the work starts, the related task in Crowdin will automatically get the *In progress* status, and when the work is finished, the task will get the Completed Vendor Project Status.

## Discussions and Comments

If needed, you can add some details to an already created task in the **Comments** section. The comments will be visible to a translator who works on the task, and they will be able to reply in the **Comments** section if needed.
