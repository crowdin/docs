<Steps>
1. Open your project and go to the **Tasks** tab.

    * In progress &ndash; the payment is processed, and the Crowdin Language Services representatives are working on the task
    * Completed &ndash; The work on the task was completed in full
</Steps>

## Translation and Proofreading Process

Once the payment is processed, the Crowdin Language Services manager will receive a notification about new tasks and will be added to your project members to manage the localization process.
Crowdin Language Services translators work directly in Crowdin Editor, so all the context information (e.g., [Screenshots](/screenshots/), [Labels](/project-settings/labels/), etc.) you added to the source files will be accessible to them as well.

A translator will be logged in to Crowdin with Crowdin Language Services profile to work on content localization. So in your Crowdin project, you will see translation activities made by the Crowdin Language Services profile. When the work starts, the related task in Crowdin will automatically get the *In progress* status, and when the work is finished, the task will get the Completed Vendor Project Status.

## Discussions and Comments

If needed, you can add some details to an already created task in the **Comments** section. The comments will be visible to a translator who works on the task, and they will be able to reply in the **Comments** section if needed.
