## Payment Options for Crowdin Language Services

When ordering translation or proofreading, you can choose from the following payment options. You can configure **Post Payment** and **Managed by Crowdin balance** settings in **Account Settings > Vendors**.

By enabling the **Do not ask for payment details** option in the settings, your selected payment method will be applied automatically each time you create a task for the Crowdin Language Services vendor.

<Aside type="tip">
  You can quickly access these settings by opening **Store > Vendors** and clicking <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon" /> on the **Crowdin Language Services** tile.
</Aside>

### Post Payment

This option allows you to pay for tasks after they are completed. If you select **Post Payment**, payments will be processed by the vendor (i.e., Alconost Inc.). This option is only available if the total value of the tasks to be created is $3000 or more.

### Managed by Crowdin Balance

With this option, you can use your dedicated Crowdin Managed Services balance to pay for translation or proofreading tasks. Crowdin Managed Services allows you to manage various localization resources and expenses from one central balance, simplifying your workflow. You can easily add funds to this balance and track your usage, ensuring easy access to translation vendors, machine translation engines, and AI models without creating separate accounts. To activate this option, ensure you have sufficient funds in your Crowdin Managed Services balance when creating tasks.

### Direct Payment at Checkout

If you are not using the **Post Payment** or **Managed by Crowdin balance** options, you can pay directly at checkout using your preferred payment method. In this case, the payment will be processed by Fastspring, Crowdin's payment processing partner.

<Aside type="caution">
  For the Wire Transfer payment method, processing may take up to 3 business days.

### Credit Returns for Proofreading

When you order proofreading from Crowdin Language Services, you can receive a credit return based on the quality of the initial translations. This system is designed to reward your efforts in improving translation quality from the start. For example, taking the time to properly configure [Crowdin AI](/crowdin-ai/) and enrich your source content with context like [screenshots](/screenshots/) and [glossaries](/glossary/) can produce excellent automated translations. The higher the quality of your pre-translated content—whether from AI, your Translation Memory (TM), or a Machine Translation (MT) engine—the less post-editing is required, and the more you save.

Here’s how it works: You pay the standard rate when creating a proofreading task. After the proofreader completes the work, they calculate the **Credit Return** based on the editing effort required for each string. This amount is then automatically added to your [Crowdin Managed Services balance](#managed-by-crowdin-balance) once the task is complete. Please note that this is a credit return, not a refund to your original payment method. Think of this balance as your virtual wallet in Crowdin, ready to be used for other services, such as future proofreading tasks, translations, or AI usage.

For example, if the pre-translations are of high quality and require no edits, the proofreading cost is only 30% of the standard rate. Conversely, for translations with match percentages below the ranges specified in the tables, the proofreading cost is 100% of the standard rate.

The calculation is based on the following net rate schemes:

## Task Status

To track the localization progress of the created tasks, follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. Open your project and go to the **Tasks** tab.
1. Click on the task's name to open it.
1. In the **Details** section, you can see the Vendor Project Status:
    * Waiting for payment &ndash; the localization services weren't paid
    * Payment in process &ndash; the payment is being processed by the Fastspring (Crowdin's payment processing partner)
    * In progress &ndash; the payment is processed, and the Crowdin Language Services representatives are working on the task
    * Completed &ndash; The work on the task was completed in full
</Steps>

## Translation and Proofreading Process

Once the payment is processed, the Crowdin Language Services manager will receive a notification about new tasks and will be added to your project members to manage the localization process.
Crowdin Language Services translators work directly in Crowdin Editor, so all the context information (e.g., [Screenshots](/screenshots/), [Labels](/project-settings/labels/), etc.) you added to the source files will be accessible to them as well.

A translator will be logged in to Crowdin with Crowdin Language Services profile to work on content localization. So in your Crowdin project, you will see translation activities made by the Crowdin Language Services profile. When the work starts, the related task in Crowdin will automatically get the *In progress* status, and when the work is finished, the task will get the Completed Vendor Project Status.

## Discussions and Comments

If needed, you can add some details to an already created task in the **Comments** section. The comments will be visible to a translator who works on the task, and they will be able to reply in the **Comments** section if needed.
