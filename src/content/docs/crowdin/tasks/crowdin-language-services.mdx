## Payment Options for Crowdin Language Services

When ordering translation or proofreading, you can choose from the following payment options.

### Post Payment

This option allows you to pay for tasks after they are completed. If you select **Post Payment**, payments will be processed by the vendor (i.e., Alconost Inc.). This option is only available if the total value of the tasks to be created is $3000 or more.

### Managed by Crowdin Balance

You can easily add funds to this balance and track your usage, ensuring easy access to translation vendors, machine translation engines, and AI models without creating separate accounts. To activate this option, ensure you have sufficient funds in your Crowdin Managed Services balance when creating tasks.

To track the localization progress of the created tasks, follow these steps:

<Steps>
1. Open your project and go to the **Tasks** tab.

    * In progress &ndash; the payment is processed, and the Crowdin Language Services representatives are working on the task

</Steps>

## Translation and Proofreading Process

Once the payment is processed, the Crowdin Language Services manager will receive a notification about new tasks and will be added to your project members to manage the localization process.

A translator will be logged in to Crowdin with Crowdin Language Services profile to work on content localization. So in your Crowdin project, you will see translation activities made by the Crowdin Language Services profile. When the work starts, the related task in Crowdin will automatically get the *In progress* status, and when the work is finished, the task will get the Completed Vendor Project Status.

## Discussions and Comments

If needed, you can add some details to an already created task in the **Comments** section. The comments will be visible to a translator who works on the task, and they will be able to reply in the **Comments** section if needed.
