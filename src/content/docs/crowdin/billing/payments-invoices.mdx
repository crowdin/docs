How you will be charged for Crowdin services depends on the subscription type you choose. There are two options available: Monthly and Annual.

### Monthly Plans

Monthly subscriptions use a recurring payment model. Once you subscribe to a monthly plan, your account limits are set according to the selected plan, and youâ€™ll be instantly charged for the first billing cycle (one month). You will then be automatically charged again at the beginning of each following billing cycle.

If you upgrade or downgrade in the middle of the monthly billing cycle, your account limits update instantly. Starting with the next billing cycle, you'll be automatically charged the rate of the new plan.

### Annual Plans

Annual subscriptions are paid upfront for the entire year. This payment is applied to your Crowdin account as a balance. Each month, Crowdin deducts the corresponding amount from this balance.

#### Changing Your Annual Subscription Plan

As your project needs change, you can upgrade or downgrade at any time. When you change your plan, the remaining balance from your previous subscription is prorated and applied to the new subscription cost at the start of the next billing cycle.

For example:

- If you purchased an annual Team plan and later downgrade to Pro, your balance will last longer than one year.
- Conversely, if you upgrade from Pro to Team, your balance may be depleted sooner.

#### Renewal of Annual Subscriptions

The renewal process depends on your chosen payment method:

- **Subscriptions purchased via FastSpring (card payments)** automatically renew each year. Crowdin sends email reminders two months and one month before your renewal date. FastSpring also sends a notification one day before your card is automatically charged for the renewal.

- **Subscriptions purchased via other payment methods (e.g., invoice)** do **not** renew automatically. Crowdin sends email reminders two months and one month before your subscription ends, prompting you to manually purchase a new subscription to continue using Crowdin.
