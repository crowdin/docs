To view your project status, estimate and count the translation cost, keep track of the most active members, and view historical data of the previously generated reports, open your project and go to the **Reports** tab.

For each report, you can select a report unit:

- Strings
- Words
- Characters without spaces
- Characters with spaces

<Image src={units} alt="Reports Units" />

## Project Status

Use this report to track the progress in your project and review key activities based on time periods.

<Aside>
  The Project Status report shows information about all the translations made in the project (including duplicate translations made by the same translator, removed translations, etc.).
</Aside>

You can find key statistics regarding your project at the top of the page:

- *Size* &ndash; the total amount of text in the project.
- *Translatable* &ndash; the amount of text visible to translators.
- *Source language* &ndash; the source language of your project.
- *Target languages* &ndash; number of the target languages in your project.
- *Members* &ndash; number of project participants.
- *Managers* &ndash; number of project managers.
- *Hidden* &ndash; the amount of text hidden from translators. The owner and managers can see them.
- *Duplicates* &ndash; the amount of text in strings repeating within the project.

<Image src={projectStatus} alt="Project Status" />

### Reviewing Activities

You can review activities based on four time periods: day, week, month, and year. Comparisons shown in percentage are counted by comparing the chosen period of time to the same previous period of time (e.g., if you select a month, the current month would be compared to the previous one).

<Image src={dashboard} alt="Reports Dashboard" />

#### Translation Activity

This chart shows the total amount of translated text, text translated with Translation Memory, and text translated with Machine Translation engines for all languages. To view the text translated for each language separately, click the expand arrow next to the chart name.

<Image src={translationActivity} alt="Translation Activity" />

#### Proofreading Activity

This chart shows the total amount of approved text and votes made for all languages. To view the text approved and votes made for each language separately, click the expand arrow next to the chart name.

<Image src={proofreadingActivity} alt="Proofreading Activity" />

#### Source Strings Activity

This chart shows the total amount of source text added and removed.

<Image src={sourceStrings} alt="Source Strings Activity" />

## Cost Estimate

Use this report to plan your budget and count the approximate cost of translations. Set the translation and approval rates to see the cost for untranslated and not approved strings in the project.

You can generate a Cost Estimate report based on the following filters:

* **General filter** &ndash; Language: All or specific target language; Strings added: All time, Today, Yesterday, Last 7 days, Last 30 days, or Custom range.
* **Task filter** &ndash; Tasks: All Tasks or specific task.

<Aside>
  Final translation cost might differ due to various factors such as added or deleted texts, multiple people translating the same string into the same language (both of them will be counted in the Translation Cost), and others.
</Aside>

### Generating a Report

To generate the Cost Estimate report, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Select the preferred currency and the report unit (word, string, character, or characters (including spaces)).
  1. Set your [rates](#rates) for translations and approvals.
  1. Select either **General Filter** or **Task Filter** to generate a report based on work to be done within a specific task. Use the available filter parameters to specify the report data you're interested in.
  1. Click **Generate**.
</Steps>

<Image src={costEstimateGenerating} alt="Generating Cost Estimate" />

<Aside>
  Rates are automatically saved after you click *Generate*.
</Aside>

### Rates

You can set the prices for Base rates (full translation, proofread) and configure Net Rate Schemes (percentage of the full translation rate paid for translation using TM suggestions).

#### Base Rates

In the Base Rates section, you can set rates for the following types of work:

* **Full translation** &ndash; for each translation made by a person.
  <Aside>If the string has several translations made by the same person, only one will be counted. If the string has several translations made by different people, each of them will be counted.</Aside>
* **Proofread** &ndash; for each approved translation.

#### Net Rate Schemes

In the Net Rate Schemes section, in addition to the base rates, you can set the percentage of the full translation rate to be paid for translations made using TM suggestions of various TM Match types. By default, you can configure the percentage of the full translation rate for the following TM Match types:

- **101 (perfect)** &ndash; for translations made using Perfect match TM suggestions (source strings are identical to TM suggestion by text and context).
- **100** &ndash; for translations made using 100% match TM suggestions (source strings are identical to TM suggestion only by text).

You can also add your own TM match types, specifying the preferred percentage of text similarity and the percentage of the full translation rate to be paid for such a translation.

To add your own TM match types, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Click <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon" /> in the Net Rate Schemes section.
  1. Click on the appeared <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" /> button.
  1. Specify the TM match range and the percentage of the full translation rate.
  1. Click the to save the settings.
</Steps>

<Image src={addTmMatchType} alt="Adding TM Match Type" width="500" />

#### Adding Individual Rates

In addition to base rates that are applied to all languages by default, you can add individual rates for specific languages. To add individual rates, click **Add individual rates**.

To select the language or languages for individual rates, click **Edit Languages** and select the ones you need. You can create as many individual rates as you need.

<Image src={addIndividualRates} alt="Adding Individual Rates" />

#### Rate Templates

If you plan to work with multiple rate configurations, save them as templates by clicking **Save as > New rates template**, then specify the template name and click **Save**.

When saving a new template you can choose the template visibility using the following options:

* **Share with all project members** &ndash; makes the template visible to all translators within the project. Regardless of the number of translators or their different rates, they all will have access to the template. It can include both general rates and individual rates for specific languages and translators, along with a net rate scheme. This transparency promotes clarity in pricing, allowing translators to review rates, generate reports on their translations, and calculate cost estimates. The key benefit is that translators understand the net rate scheme and can apply their base rate, even if it's not included in the template.

* **Share with managers within the ownerâ€™s projects** &ndash; makes the template global, visible only to managers across all projects of an owner. This option streamlines rate consistency across various projects.

If neither of the options is selected, the template remains visible only to managers within the current project, limiting access to a select group of project members. These options provide flexibility in controlling who can view and use the rate template to accommodate different organizational preferences.

Saved templates allows you to quickly switch between different configurations for report generation.

Click **Templates** to view and manage your saved rate templates.

### Include Pre-translated Strings

Select **Include pre-translated strings** if you want to include pre-translated strings in a Cost Estimate report. By default, this option is selected.

For example, you have an untranslated string `Validate your username` in your project. You generate a Cost Estimate report with the **Include pre-translated strings** option selected. This string will be included in the Cost Estimate. Then you pre-translate this string via TM or MT engine and once again generate a Cost Estimate report with the **Include pre-translated strings** option selected. This time, the pre-translated string `Validate your username` won't be included in the Cost Estimate report.

On the other hand, with the **Include pre-translated strings** option cleared, the string `Validate your username` will be included in the Cost Estimate report both times, when untranslated and when pre-translated via TM or MT engine.

### Calculate Internal Fuzzy Matches

Internal Fuzzy Matches &ndash; Fuzzy TM matches found among the untranslated strings that potentially can be added to TM. For example, if the first string in the file is `Validate your username`, and the last one is `Validate your username again`, there will be an internal fuzzy match.

To get a more deliberate report that includes a prediction of internal fuzzy matches, select **Calculate Internal Fuzzy Matches**.

This way, all the internal matches would be counted to see how many strings can be added to TM if the strings are translated one by one as listed.
Keep in mind that calculations are approximate because strings might be translated in a different order.

<Aside>
  Internal Fuzzy Matches would be counted according to the Net Rate Schemes configurations.
</Aside>

### Result Analysis

When the report is generated, you will see the following amounts:

* The general cost estimate for all languages.
* The cost estimate for translation and proofreading.
* The amount of untranslated texts.
* The amount of untranslated texts with no TM match.
* The amount of texts with possible TM match.
* The amount of Internal Fuzzy Matches &ndash; Perfect and 100% matches found among the untranslated strings that potentially can be added to TM.
* The amount of not approved texts.
* The estimated amount of savings for translations made with TM suggestions.
* Table with the listed amount of TM matches found within the project.
* Table with the list of untranslated and not approved files in the project. Columns include the amount of not approved, internal TM matches, TM Match, and untranslated in each listed file.

To download the Cost Estimate report, click **Export** and select the preferred export format (CSV, XLSX, or JSON).

<Image src={costEstimateGenerated} alt="Cost Estimate Generated" />

## Translation Cost

Use this report to calculate the actual translation cost based on the completed job.

You can generate a Translation Cost report based on the following filters:

* **General filter** &ndash; Group by: Member or language; Time period: All time, Today, Yesterday, Last 7 days, Last 30 days, or Custom range; Files: All files (including deleted) or Selected files (excluding deleted); Language: All or specific target language; Users: one or a few specific users.
* **Task filter** &ndash; Tasks: All Tasks or specific task.

### Generating a Report

To generate the Translation Cost report, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Select the preferred currency and the report unit (word, string, character, or characters (including spaces)).
  1. Set your rates for translations and approvals.
  1. Select either **General Filter** or **Task Filter** to generate a report based on work to be done within a specific task. Use the available filter parameters to specify the report data you're interested in.
  1. Click **Generate**.
</Steps>

<Image src={translationCostGenerating} alt="Generating Translation Cost" />

<Aside>
  Rates are automatically saved after you click **Generate**.
</Aside>

### Rates {#rates-translation-cost}

You can set the prices for Base rates (full translation, proofread) and configure Net Rate Schemes (percentage of the full translation rate paid for translation using TM suggestions, MT suggestions, and existing translations).

#### Base Rates

In the Base Rates section, you can set rates for the following types of work:

* **Full translation** &ndash; for each translation made by a person.
  <Aside>If the string has several translations made by the same person, only one will be counted. If the string has several translations made by different people, each of them will be counted.</Aside>
* **Proofread** &ndash; for each approved translation.

#### Net Rate Schemes

In the Net Rate Schemes section, in addition to the base rates, you can set the percentage of the full translation rate to be paid for translations made using TM suggestions, MT suggestions, and other translations of various Match types.

By default, you can configure the percentage of the full translation rate for the following match types categories:

**TM Match types:**
- **101 (perfect)** &ndash; for translations made using Perfect match TM suggestions (source strings are identical to TM suggestion by text and context).
- **100** &ndash; for translations made using 100% match TM suggestions (source strings are identical to TM suggestion only by text).

**MT Match types:**
- **100** &ndash; for translations made using 100% match MT suggestions (new suggested translations are identical to MT suggestion).

**Other translations types:**
- **100** &ndash; for translations made using existing translations (new suggested translations are identical to the existing translations).

If a string has a combination of TM and MT suggestions and existing translations, the new translation is counted at the lowest Net Rate Scheme value. For example, if a string has a 101% (perfect) TM match suggestion (10% of the full translation rate) and a 100% MT match suggestion (5% of the full translation rate), the new translation added to this string will be counted at a 5% of the full translation rate.

You can also add your own TM, MT, and Other translations match types, specifying the preferred percentage of text similarity and the percentage of the full translation rate to be paid for such a translation.

To add your own match types, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Click <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon" /> in the Net Rate Schemes section.
  1. Click on the appeared <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" /> button.
  1. Specify the match range and the percentage of the full translation rate.
  1. Click the to save the settings.
</Steps>

<Image src={addMtMatchType} alt="Adding MT/Other Translation Match Type" />

#### Adding Individual Rates

In addition to base rates that are applied to all languages and users by default, you can add individual rates for specific languages and users. To add individual rates, click **Add individual rates**.

To select the languages and users for individual rates, click **Edit Languages** and **Edit Users** and select the ones you need. You can create as many individual rates as you need.

<Image src={addIndividualRatesTranslationCost} alt="Adding Individual Rates" />

### Result Analysis

When the report is generated, you will see the following amounts:

* Information about users: profile picture, full name, username, and role.
* Costs: total and separate for each user (for all contributions, contributions to a specific language, distinguished for translated and approved text by a member), and the amount of savings for translations made with TM and MT suggestions.

To download the Cost Estimate report, click **Export** and select the preferred export format (CSV, XLSX, or JSON).

## Contribution Raw Data Report

In addition to the Translation Cost report, which is based on the Contribution Raw Data and grouped by languages, you can retrieve this detailed contribution raw data using the [Generate Report](https://developer.crowdin.com/api/v2/#operation/api.projects.reports.post) (Contribution Raw Data schema) or via the [Raw Report Data](https://store.crowdin.com/raw-report) app available on the Crowdin Store. This allows you to generate your own custom report according to your specific requirements.

The Contribution Raw Data report provides various columns depending on the selected mode (translations, approvals, or votes). Each column offers specific insights, for example `source string text hash`, which is useful for identifying changes in source strings despite having the same `stringId`. It's important to note that multiple records can exist for the same `stringId` if the source hash or plural form varies.

For repeated translations by the same user on the same source string, into the same target language, the same plural form, and if the source text has not changed, only the `translationId`, `targetUnits`, and `updatedAt` columns will update in the report statistics. Deleted translations are also included in the count. Understanding these columns can help you better interpret the raw data and optimize your localization process.

View the available report columns and their mode applicability (i.e., translations, approvals, and votes) in the following table:

## Top Members

To see who contributed the most to your projectâ€™s translation, generate a list of top members.

### Generating a List of Top Members

To generate a list of top members, set a time period for which you want to see the activity of translators and the report unit. When you set the parameters, click **Generate** to see the list. By default, the list would include translators for all languages. To make a list of translators for a specific language, select the language you need from the drop-down menu above the list. To find a specific member, use the search field next to the drop-down menu. To open the memberâ€™s profile page, double-click on the name.

The list has the following columns:

- *Name* &ndash; a translator's full name and username.
- *Languages* &ndash; project languages.
- *Translated* &ndash; the amount of translated source content.
- *Target Words* &ndash; the amount of translated target content.
<br/> This parameter is not available for the strings report unit because the amount of source and translated strings is always the same.
- *Approved* &ndash; the amount of approved content.
- *Voted* &ndash; the number of votes a translator made.
- *"+" votes received* &ndash; the number of upvotes a translator received for translations.
- *"-" votes received* &ndash; the number of downvotes a translator received for translations.
- *Winning* &ndash; the number of approvals a translator received for translations.
- *Joined* &ndash; the date a member joined a project.

To show or hide some columns, click <Icon name="material-symbols:table-chart" class="inline-icon" /> on the top-right side of the table and select the preferred ones.

<Image src={topMembers} alt="Generating a list of Top Members" />

## Archive

The Archive section allows you to access the records of previously generated Cost estimate and Translation cost reports, providing a convenient way to review historical data.

This section also eliminates the need to wait for a report generation to complete. You can initiate a report generation and return to it later at your convenience. Within the Archive, you can review the report summary and, if necessary, download it in various supported file formats.

Each project has its own independent archive section with previously generated reports available only to project members with manager permissions (or higher).

Reports generated by translators based on their contributions are not added to the archives.

### Viewing Previously Generated Reports

To view the summary of the previously generated reports (i.e., archive records), follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to **Reports > Archive**.
  1. Click on the name of the needed archive record.
  1. Once you open the archive report record, you can view all the needed data.
</Steps>
