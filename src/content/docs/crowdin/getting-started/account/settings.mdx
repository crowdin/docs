### Removing Account

For security reasons, we cannot delete an account on behalf of the user. You must have access to your Crowdin account to be able to delete it.

To delete your account, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your **Account Settings** and go to the **Profile** tab.
  1. Scroll down to the **Remove Account** section.
  1. Click **Remove Account**.
</Steps>

<Aside type="danger">

</Aside>

Once you remove your account, your translations, comments, terms, and votes will be preserved and appear as added by a **Removed User**.

## Account

In the **Account** tab, you can change your password, set up the two-factor authentication, set up OAuth connections with Facebook, Google, or any other single sign-on providers, and see the sessions list.

### Changing Password

In the **Password** section, you can change your current password. To do this, click **Change Password** and follow the instructions.

If you registered via Facebook, Google, or any other single sign-on provider, add another way to log in by creating a password for your Crowdin account by clicking **Create Password**.

### Two-Factor Authentication

Activate Two-factor authentication to ensure an additional level of security for your Crowdin account. Every time you log in, along with your username and password, you will use an authentication code.

To enable Two-factor authentication, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your **Account Settings** and go to the **Password & Connections** tab.
  2. Enable **Two-Factor Authentication**.
  3. Using the **Google Authenticator** app on your mobile device, scan the QR code on the screen.
  4. Enter the 6-digit verification code generated by your authenticator app, then click **Next**. <Image src={twoFactorAuthenticationQRCode} alt="Authenticator app" class="width-md" />
  5. Download recovery codes, so you can use them if you can't access your mobile device. <Image src={twoFactorAuthenticationRecoveryCodes} alt="Recovery codes" class="width-md" />
</Steps>

### Auth Providers

In the **Auth Providers** section, you can connect your Facebook, Google, X, GitHub, or GitLab accounts to log into your Crowdin account with one click.

### Sessions

In the **Sessions** section, you can review the list of devices (including the location, last activity date, IP address, browser, and operating system) logged into your Crowdin account.

If there are any sessions you don't recognize, you can revoke them by clicking **Revoke** on the specific session. Alternatively, you can revoke all but the active session by clicking **Revoke All**.

<Image src={sessions} alt="Sessions" />

### Sudo Mode

Crowdin asks you to confirm your password before you can perform any of the sudo-protected actions. They include creating/changing your password and email, connecting/disconnecting SSO, enabling/disabling two-factor authentication, creating personal access tokens, and deleting your account.

After you've confirmed your password, you can perform the sudo-protected actions without additional re-authentication within the next five minutes.

<Image src={sudoModeConfirmingCredentials} alt="Confirming credentials" class="width-md" />

## Notifications

In the **Notifications** tab, you can enable notifications you’d like to receive and disable the ones that require less attention. You can select the types of events in Crowdin, channels to receive updates, and set notification rules for particular projects.

### Channels & Events

There are four channels Crowdin can send notifications to:

* In-App (Crowdin)
* Email
* Slack
* Custom

You can enable the desired channel by selecting the checkbox under the channel's name, either In-App, Email, Slack, or Custom. Customize notifications for each of the channels. Select the checkboxes next to the events you’d like to be notified of.

The following notification events are available:

<Include file="notification-types-crowdin.mdx" />

</ReadMore>

### Slack Notifications

To select Slack as a notification channel, click **Connect Slack** and authorize the connection with Crowdin on the Slack side. After the simple setup, you’ll be able to select notifications to get via Slack.

<ReadMore>
  Read more about [Slack Integration](/account-notifications/#slack-integration).
</ReadMore>

### Default Notifications

By default, Crowdin will send you updates on the new events happening in Crowdin via email and notify you in the app. You can change notification settings anytime.

### Disable Notifications

To disable notifications, clear the checkbox next to the notification type. You can also clear the checkbox under the channel's name to disable all notification types. Once all the boxes below are disabled, you won’t receive notifications via this channel.

<Image src={disableNotifications} alt="Disable Notifications" />

### Notification Rules for Projects

You can also configure notification preferences on the project level:

- **Global**: Notifications selected for global settings.
- **Mentions only**: Only when @mentioned.
- **Mute project**: Turn off notifications.

<Image src={projectNotifications} alt="Project Notifications" />

## Billing

The **Billing** tab in your **Account Settings** becomes available as soon as you subscribe to one of Crowdin's plans. Within this tab, you can manage your subscriptions, download invoices, and change your subscription plan.

<ReadMore>
  Read more about [Changing Subscription Plan](/changing-subscription-plan/).
</ReadMore>

## API

In the **API** tab, you can generate personal access tokens needed for authorization while working with Crowdin API.

Personal access tokens are the alternative passwords you can use to authorize third-party applications and scripts into Crowdin Enterprise.

<Image src={tokens} alt="Personal Access Tokens" />

<Aside type="caution">
  Treat personal access tokens like passwords and keep them secret. Use tokens as environmental variables instead of hardcoding them into your scripts.
</Aside>

### Creating a Personal Access Token

When creating a new personal access token, you can select [specific scopes](/developer/understanding-scopes/) and, if needed, limit the visibility of resources for the selected scopes using the **Granular access** option. For example, you can create a token that should interact only with a specific project and have no access to others. As a result, only the selected projects will be gained when retrieving a list of all projects.

To create a new personal access token, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your **Account Settings** and go to the **API** tab.
  1. Click **New Token**.
  1. In the appeared dialog, specify the token name to be able to identify it later.
  1. Select the necessary set of scopes.
  1. *(Optional)* To limit access to specific resources, select **Granular access**. <Aside>If **Granular access** is selected, ensure to select some resources for the selected scopes.</Aside>
  1. Depending on the selected scopes, select **Grant access to selected projects**, **Grant access to selected TMs**, and **Grant access to selected Glossaries**.
  1. Click **Select projects**, **Select glossaries**, **Select TMs**, and respectively select the needed resources.
  1. Click **Create**.
</Steps>

After generating a new token, be sure to record it right away. For security purposes, it will not be shown again. You can create as many personal access tokens as you need from your Crowdin account.

<Aside type="caution">
  If a resource wasn't selected during the personal access token creation, but you still try to access it with its ID, the `404 Not Found` response will be received.
</Aside>

### Revoking a Personal Access Token

You might need to revoke a personal access token if you no longer use it or suspect it has been compromised.

To revoke a personal access token, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your **Account Settings** and go to the **API** tab.
  1. Find the necessary token in the list and click **Revoke** next to it to delete a personal access token and remove its access.
</Steps>

## Security Log

The **Security Log** tab lets you track important events (including event type, used device, IP address, and date) that happen with your Crowdin account.

Security log includes events like logins, password and username changes, and others.

## OAuth

In the **OAuth** tab, you can create an OAuth Application that could be used to make authorized requests to Crowdin API or as a Single Sign-On service.

Some of the most common uses for this feature include:

- OAuth apps allow you to make authorized requests to the [Crowdin API](/developer/api/).
- OAuth apps are often used as a single sign-on service. You can allow users to sign in to your service with their Crowdin accounts.

### Adding a New Application

To add a new application, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. In the upper-right corner, click on your profile picture and select **Settings**.
  1. Switch to the **OAuth** tab and click **New Application**.
  1. In the appeared dialog, specify the following information:
     * **Name** and **Description** &ndash; (optional) will be displayed to users when they authorize the app to access their Crowdin accounts.
     * **Authorization callback URLs** &ndash; the URLs to which users will be sent after they authorize with Crowdin. You can add multiple URLs separated by commas (no need to use quotes).
     * Select the access your app needs from the list of available [Scopes](/developer/understanding-scopes/).
  1. Click **Create**. <Image src={oauthAppsNewApp} alt="Create OAuth App" class="width-md" />
</Steps>

<Aside>
  By default, newly created OAuth apps are restricted to the app owner’s Crowdin projects. To make them available Crowdin-wide, [Contact Support Team](https://crowdin.com/contacts) with the respective request.
</Aside>

### Modifying an OAuth App

After you create an OAuth application, you can make changes to it. Go to your account's **Settings > OAuth Applications** to see the list of OAuth apps created under your account, the dates the apps were created, and how many users are using each app.

Click <Icon name="mdi:dots-horizontal" class="inline-icon" /> in the *Actions* column on the necessary app to open the context menu.

Using the available options, you can do the following:
* **Edit** &ndash; update the application name, description, URLs, and scopes. Access Client ID and Client Secret of the created application.
  <Image src={oauthAppsEdit} alt="Oauth App info" class="width-md" />
* **Reset secret** &ndash; Reset the Client Secret for the app.
* **Revoke tokens** &ndash; Revoke all user tokens.
* **Delete** &ndash; Delete the application.

## Beta Features

In the **Beta Features** tab, you can select the **Enable beta features** option to test new experimental features.
