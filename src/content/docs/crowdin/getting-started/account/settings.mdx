### Delete Account

For security reasons, we cannot delete an account on behalf of the user. You must have access to your Crowdin account to be able to delete it.

To delete your account, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your **Account Settings** and go to the **Profile** tab.
  1. Scroll down to the **Remove Account** section.
  1. Click **Remove Account**.
</Steps>

<Aside type="danger">
  Deleting an account will immediately delete all projects created under your account and all associated data. Deleted accounts cannot be restored!
</Aside>

Once your account is deleted, your translations, comments, terms, and votes will remain in the system but will appear as added by a **Removed User**.

## Account

In the **Account** tab, you can manage your password, enhance account security with security keys and passkeys, set up two-factor authentication, manage linked authentication providers, and review active sessions. You can also verify new devices and enable sudo mode for additional security during sensitive actions.

### Changing Password

In the **Password** section, you can change your current password by clicking **Change Password** and following the instructions. If your account was created through an authentication provider like Google or Facebook, you can create a new password to log in without using these providers.

### Security Keys and Passkey

In the **Security Keys and Passkey** section, you can register a physical security key or passkey to add an extra layer of protection to your account. This key works alongside your password to verify your identity during login.

### Authenticator app

In the **Authenticator app** section, you can enable two-factor authentication (2FA) to add an additional layer of security to your account. Use an authenticator app on your mobile device or computer to generate one-time verification codes.

To enable two-factor authentication, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your **Account Settings** and go to the **Account** tab.
  2. Click **Enable** in the **Authenticator app** section.
  3. Using the **Google Authenticator** app on your mobile device, scan the QR code on the screen.
  4. Enter the 6-digit verification code generated by your authenticator app, then click **Next**. <Image src={twoFactorAuthenticationQRCode} alt="Authenticator app" class="width-md" />
  5. Download recovery codes, so you can use them if you can't access your mobile device. <Image src={twoFactorAuthenticationRecoveryCodes} alt="Recovery codes" class="width-md" />
</Steps>

### New Device Verification

Enable **New Device Verification** to add an extra security step when logging in from a new device. Crowdin will send a verification code to your registered email address to confirm your identity before allowing access from the new device. Once you successfully log in, the device will be added to the list of trusted devices.

<Aside>
  You can disable this option only if you are using any 2FA, like Authenticator app or Security Keys.
</Aside>

After enabling this feature, you will see a list of trusted devices. You can remove any device from the list by clicking the **Remove** button. Alternatively, you can remove all trusted devices by clicking **Remove all devices**.

### Auth Providers

In the **Auth Providers** section, you can manage the accounts linked to your Crowdin account. These connections allow you to log in with a single click using providers like Google, Facebook, GitHub, X, GitLab, and Crowdin Enterprise.

### Sessions

In the **Sessions** section, you can view the list of devices that have accessed your Crowdin account, including details like location, last activity date, IP address, and device type. Revoke individual sessions that you don't recognize, or revoke all except your current session by clicking **Revoke All**.

<Image src={sessions} alt="Sessions" />

### Sudo Mode

Crowdin asks you to confirm your password before performing sensitive actions, such as changing your password, managing email or authentication settings, and deleting your account. Once confirmed, you can perform these actions without re-authenticating for the next five minutes.

<Image src={sudoModeConfirmingCredentials} alt="Confirming credentials" class="width-md" />

## Notifications

In the **Notifications** tab, you can customize which notifications you receive and how they are delivered. This includes setting preferences for different notification channels and configuring rules for specific projects.

## API

In the **API** tab, you can create personal access tokens for authorization when working with the Crowdin API and view your account's API call history.

### Personal Access Tokens

Personal access tokens serve as alternative passwords for authorizing third-party applications and scripts in Crowdin.

<Image src={tokens} alt="Personal Access Tokens" />

<Aside type="caution">
  Treat personal access tokens like passwords and keep them secure. Use tokens as environment variables instead of hardcoding them into your scripts.
</Aside>

### Creating a Personal Access Token

When creating a new personal access token, you can select [specific scopes](/developer/understanding-scopes/) and, if needed, limit the visibility of resources for the selected scopes using the **Granular access** option. For example, you can create a token that should interact only with a specific project and have no access to others. As a result, only the selected projects will be gained when retrieving a list of all projects.

To create a new personal access token, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your **Account Settings** and go to the **API** tab.
  1. Click **New Token**.
  1. In the appeared dialog, specify the token name to identify it later.
  1. Select the necessary set of scopes.
  1. *(Optional)* To limit access to specific resources, click **Granular access** and select the required scopes and related resources.
  1. Click **Create**.
</Steps>

After creating a new token, be sure to record it immediately. For security reasons, it will not be shown again. You can create as many personal access tokens as you need from your Crowdin account.

<Aside type="caution">
  If a resource wasn't selected during the personal access token creation, and you attempt to access it using its ID, you will receive a `404 Not Found` response.
</Aside>

### Revoking a Personal Access Token

You may need to revoke a personal access token if you no longer use it or suspect it has been compromised.

To revoke a personal access token, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your **Account Settings** and go to the **API** tab.
  1. Find the necessary token in the list and click **Revoke** next to it to delete the personal access token and remove its access.
</Steps>

### Calls History

In the **Calls History** section, you can view a list of API calls associated with your Crowdin account. Use the filter to view all, successful, or unsuccessful calls, and select specific action groups or individual actions within them. The **Application Name** field allows you to search for calls related to a particular application.

## Apps

In the **Apps** tab, manage the Crowdin Apps installed in your Crowdin account. You can view and manage currently installed apps, search for specific ones, and use the **Edit** or **Uninstall** options on each app.

Click **Install from store** to add apps developed by Crowdin and other developers from the Crowdin [Store](https://store.crowdin.com/). Alternatively, click **Install Private App** to manually install custom apps of your own development.

</ReadMore>

## Agents

Manage agents for custom applications that interact with Crowdin. Agents allow applications to perform specific actions on your behalf within the platform. You can add Agents from the [Crowdin Store](https://store.crowdin.com/tags/agent) and manage their permissions to projects and resources as needed.

## Security Log

The **Security Log** tab lets you track important events (including event type, used device, IP address, and date) that happen with your Crowdin account.

Security log includes events like logins, password and username changes, and others.

## Webhooks

In the **Webhooks** tab, you can configure account webhooks to receive notifications about key events that happen in your Crowdin account. Once set up, Crowdin will send POST or GET requests with data to the specified webhook URL via HTTP when these events occur.

You can create account webhooks for the following event types:

* Project created
* Project deleted

<ReadMore>
  Read more about [Webhooks](/webhooks/).
</ReadMore>

<Aside type="caution" title="Limitations">
  You can configure up to 20 webhook endpoints for account-level events.
</Aside>

## OAuth

In the **OAuth** tab, you can create an OAuth Application that could be used to make authorized requests to Crowdin API or as a Single Sign-On service and manage connected OAuth apps you've authorized to use your account.

Some of the most common uses for this feature include:

- OAuth apps allow you to make authorized requests to the [Crowdin API](/developer/api/).
- OAuth apps are often used as a single sign-on service. You can allow users to sign in to your service with their Crowdin accounts.

<ReadMore>
  See the [Authorizing OAuth Apps](/developer/authorizing-oauth-apps/) to learn how to authorize OAuth apps to access your Crowdin account.
</ReadMore>

### Adding a New Application

To add a new application, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. In the upper-right corner, click on your profile picture and select **Settings**.
  1. Switch to the **OAuth** tab and click **New Application**.
  1. In the appeared dialog, specify the following information:
     * **Name** and **Description** &ndash; (optional) will be displayed to users when they authorize the app to access their Crowdin accounts.
     * **Authorization callback URLs** &ndash; the URLs to which users will be sent after they authorize with Crowdin. You can add multiple URLs separated by commas (no need to use quotes).
     * Select the access your app needs from the list of available [Scopes](/developer/understanding-scopes/).
  1. Click **Create**. <Image src={oauthAppsNewApp} alt="Create OAuth App" class="width-md crowdin-modal" />
</Steps>

<Aside>
  By default, newly created OAuth apps are restricted to the app owner’s Crowdin projects. To make them available Crowdin-wide, [Contact Support Team](https://crowdin.com/contacts) with the respective request.
</Aside>

### Modifying an OAuth App

After you create an OAuth application, you can make changes to it. Go to your account's **Settings > OAuth Applications** to see the list of OAuth apps created under your account, the dates the apps were created, and how many users are using each app.

Click <Icon name="mdi:dots-horizontal" class="inline-icon" /> in the *Actions* column on the necessary app to open the context menu.

Using the available options, you can do the following:

* **Edit** &ndash; update the application name, description, URLs, and scopes. Access Client ID and Client Secret of the created application.
* **Reset secret** &ndash; Reset the Client Secret for the app.
* **Revoke tokens** &ndash; Revoke all user tokens.
* **Delete** &ndash; Delete the application.

### Managing Connected OAuth Applications

In the **Connected OAuth Applications** section, you can view connected OAuth apps you've authorized to use your account and revoke access as needed.
