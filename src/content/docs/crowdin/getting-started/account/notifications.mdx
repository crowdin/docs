Crowdin offers several types of notifications to meet the different needs of users, such as the following:

- *Project Updates*: Notify users of changes to the project, such as new content to translate or updates to existing content.
- *Translation Activity*: Notify users of new translations, approvals, or comments on translations.
- *Task Management*: These notifications inform users about new tasks, deadlines and task completions.
- *Team Communication*: These alerts notify users of messages and discussions within the project.

To see the notifications, click on the bell icon <Icon name="mdi:bell-outline" class="inline-icon" /> in the top right corner of the page.

## Slack Integration

With updates sent directly to Slack, you'll instantly know what's happening in the Crowdin projects you manage or contribute to. After integrating your Crowdin account with Slack, select the notifications you'd like to receive, and the Crowdin bot will send them as direct messages.

<Aside>
  Slack integration for Crowdin must be configured for each individual user who wants to receive notifications in Slack.

<Steps>
  1. In the upper-right corner, click on your profile picture and select **Settings**.
  2. Switch to the **Notifications** tab and click **Connect Slack**. <Image src={slackConnect} alt="Connect Slack" />

You can disable notifications and disconnect Slack from Crowdin anytime.

## Custom Notifications

Custom Notifications allow you to receive information about the new events that happen in Crowdin. Once you configure custom notifications for your account, Crowdin will start sending POST requests with data to the custom notification URL via HTTP.

### Use Cases

You can configure custom notifications to build integrations with the services or with your backend. For example:

* Set up custom notifications to send notifications to the system you use.
* Pass information to the third-party services with the specific request requirements (e.g., content type, headers, payload).
* Create custom integrations with Crowdin.

### Configuring

To configure custom notifications in Crowdin, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your **Account Settings** and go to the **Notifications** tab.
  2. In the **Notifications Custom Channel** section, click **Set Up Notifications Custom Channel** to start configuring your custom notifications.
</Steps>

You will need to provide the following information to set up custom notifications:

* The URL where the callback should be sent.
* The content type for the POST request method (`multipart/form-data`, `application/json`, or `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`).

Optionally, you can add special headers to your custom notifications. They can be used for additional security, as an authorization method, and more. For example, if you add headers, your custom notification endpoint can verify them and ensure that information is coming from Crowdin.

When configuring custom notifications, click **Test notification** to see how your application will react to that call. Once finished with the configuration, click **Save**.

Depending on your approach to custom notification management, you might need to add dedicated Crowdin IP addresses to your firewall to allow Crowdin to open the pre-configured custom notification URLs.

### Custom Payloads

You can modify the custom notification payload to add and organize the elements as your system requires. To get informative and user-friendly notifications, make sure to include the `{{notification-message}}` placeholder in your payload.
