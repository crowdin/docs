> Crowdin is a localization management platform that helps companies, teams, and individuals stay agile when translating products like mobile, desktop & web apps, websites, games, help documentation, and more.

In this article, we'll walk you through a typical localization workflow for managers in Crowdin. We'll cover creating a project, uploading content, inviting project members, pre-translating your project, generating reports, and downloading translations.

## Create a Project

Create a project to be able to upload your content for localization. When creating a project, you can select the preferred *project visibility*, *project type*, and select the source and target languages.

Once you've created a project, you can add content to be translated. Each project has its own source content, resources, target languages, integrations, members, etc.

## Upload Content

Once you've created the project, upload localizable files and resources, such as screenshots, translation memory, and glossary.

### Upload Source Files for Localization

You can upload localizable files in a way that works best for you:

* Manually via the web interface (UI).
* Integrate Crowdin with the tools you already use:
  * Repo *(GitHub, GitLab, etc.)*
  * Marketing tools *(Contentful, Webflow, WPML, Hubspot, Marketo, etc.)*
  * Help center *(Help Scout, Zendesk, Intercom, etc.)*
  * Development tools *(VS Code, Android Studio, Google Play, etc.)*
  * Email automation *(MailChimp, SendPulse, ActiveCampaign, Mandrill, Moosend, etc.)*
  * Design tools *(Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD)*.
* Use API or console client.

To automatically sync files between your Crowdin project and the tools of your choice, add and set up the respective integration. Once you add the integration, you can proceed to the setup.

### Upload Existing Translations

If you already have some translations done outside Crowdin, you can upload them to your Crowdin project to keep everything in one place and continue working on translations.

### Upload Localization Resources

In most cases, you might have localization resources like [Translation Memory](/translation-memory/) and [Glossary](/glossary/). It is a good idea to upload them to your Crowdin project since these localization resources help your translators during the translation process and ensure high translation quality.

### Upload Screenshots

Screenshots are another great way to provide additional context so translators can understand better how they should translate the source strings. To upload screenshots, open your project and go to the **Screenshots** tab. Tag the source strings on the screenshots. This way, screenshots with tagged strings will appear under each string in the Editor's Context and Translations section.

## Pre-translate Your Project

To save time, you can pre-translate your Crowdin project using [Translation Memory](/translation-memory/) (TM), [Machine Translation](/machine-translation/) (MT), or [AI](/crowdin-ai/). Pre-translating your content means some strings will already be translated before translators begin their work.

You can apply pre-translation manually or set up automatic pre-translation, so each time new content is added, it's translated automatically based on your settings.

## Invite People

Decide who will translate and manage your content. You can collaborate with professional translation agencies (i.e., vendors) integrated with Crowdin or invite your own team.

If you decide to work with agencies, go to **Store > Vendors** to select a translation vendor that meets your requirements.

If you decide to invite your own team, open your project and go to the **Members** tab to add people by Crowdin username, email, or invitation link. Based on what each person will do in the project, you can assign the following roles: Manager, Developer / Translation Requestor, Language Coordinator, Proofreader, and Translator.

Once added to the project, team members can start working in the [Editor](/online-editor/) or access other project areas depending on their role.

## Managing Language Requests

Project members can request new target languages for a project directly from project's **Dashboard** tab by clicking **Request New Language**. As a project manager, you will receive these requests as notifications, which you can then review and add a new language if needed.

To manage these requests effectively, you first need to ensure your notifications are correctly configured.

### Enabling Notifications for Requests

To receive alerts when a user requests a language, you must have the appropriate notifications enabled in your **Account Settings**.

<Steps>
  1. Go to **Account Settings > Notifications**.
  2. Select **Language Requests** for your preferred notification channels (e.g., In-app, Email, Slack).
</Steps>

<Aside type="tip">
  For timely reviews, consider enabling notifications for channels you check frequently, such as email or Slack.
</Aside>

### Reviewing a Language Request

Once a user requests a new language, you will be notified.

<Steps>
  1. Click the bell icon <Icon name="mdi:bell-outline" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-right corner to see new notifications in a dropdown list.
  2. For a complete list of all notifications, click **See all**.
  3. On the **Notifications** page, find the request. The notification will show the project, the requested language, the user who sent the request, and any comments they provided.
  4. Click **Language Settings** to go directly to the project’s **Settings > Languages** page to add the requested language to the project.
</Steps>

## Generate Reports

Crowdin provides project-level reports to help you track progress, evaluate translation accuracy, estimate and count costs, and measure contributor activity. To access them, open your project and go to the **Reports** tab.

Available reports include:

* Overview
* Cost Estimate
* Translation Cost
* Pre-translation Accuracy
* Translator Accuracy
* Top Members
* Archive

## Download Translations

You can download translations manually using the web interface (UI) or set up automated delivery using integrations (e.g., GitHub or other connected tools), the Crowdin API, the console client (CLI), or CDN Distributions.

Translations are downloaded according to the export settings configured in the project's **Settings** tab.
