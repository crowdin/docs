Crowdin provides team cooperation features (e.g., inviting project members, defining permission levels, tasks, messages, etc.), workflow automation, integrations and plugins, and many more features you would need for efficient project localization.

To start your migration, you can use the following step-by-step migration instructions.

## In Your Previous Translation Tool

* **Download source files**
In most cases, you’ll have them on your machine/server, so this step is optional.

* **Download translations**
Download all the latest translations you have at the moment of transition.

* **Download TM and Glossary**
Download the translation memory and glossary so your translators can reuse them in your Crowdin projects.

## In Crowdin

#### Sign up and create your localization project

Sign up or log in if you already have your Crowdin account and [create a project](/creating-project) to which you’ll migrate your data.

#### Upload source files

There are a couple of ways you can upload your source files to the Crowdin project. Use one of the following options:

* via **Sources > Files** (for File-based projects) or via the **Upload** tab (for String-based projects)
* via direct integration with external services (e.g., [GitHub](/github-integration/), [GitLab](/gitlab-integration/), etc.) Explore available integrations on the Crowdin [Store](https://store.crowdin.com/)
* via [Console Client (CLI)](https://crowdin.github.io/crowdin-cli/)
* via [API](https://developer.crowdin.com/crowdin-apps-about/)

  If you work with a source file format not listed in the [Supported Formats](/supported-formats) article, we can develop custom pre-/post-processors for you. Feel free to contact our Support team with an inquiry.

#### Upload Existing Translations

Upload your existing translations to ensure that your previous work won’t be lost and that you continue from where you performed the transition. If you plan to use integrations with [GitHub](/github-integration/), [GitLab](/gitlab-integration/), or other services, your existing translations could be uploaded in an automated way.

:::note
Uploading translations from a repo to your Crowdin project is only available for file-based projects.

#### Upload TM and Glossary

If you have [Translation Memory](/translation-memory/) (TM) and [Glossary](/glossary/) from your previous translation tool, feel free to upload them to your Crowdin project. These localization resources might greatly help your translators during the translation process and ensure high-quality translations.
