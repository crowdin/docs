Roles in Crowdin define the level of access and control users have within the platform. By assigning roles, you can manage user permissions across the Editor, project settings, and resources.

Below you can find descriptions of each role and its associated permissions.

## Owner

Owner is the user who created the project and has complete control over it. The owner can invite users to the project and manage their access, work with source and translation files, configure project settings, and manage account-level resources such as AI providers, MT engines, and more.

  Project ownership can't be changed.

## Manager

Manager has similar rights to the project owner within assigned projects. They can manage project members, files, localization resources (i.e., TMs and Glossaries), tasks, integrations, reports, and other project-specific resources. Managers can’t delete projects or configure the project owner’s account-level resources such as AI providers or MT engines.

**Use case:** Suitable for trusted team members who manage the full localization process within specific projects.

## Developer

Developer can upload source files, edit translatable text, connect integrations, and access the API. They don’t have permissions to manage project members, tasks, or reports.

**Use case:** Suitable for users handling the technical aspects of localization, such as file management, integration setup, or automation.

## Language Coordinator

Language Coordinator can manage certain project features only for their assigned languages. They can translate and approve strings, manage project members and join requests, generate project reports, create tasks, and pre-translate content. Language Coordinators cannot access other project settings such as source files, integrations, or project configurations.

**Use case:** Suitable for users coordinating translations across specific project languages.

## Proofreader

Proofreader can translate and approve strings within assigned projects. They do not have access to project settings or management functions.

**Use case:** Suitable for users focused on finalizing translations and ensuring quality.

## Translator

Translator can add translations and vote on suggestions made by others. They do not have the ability to approve translations or access project settings.

**Use case:** Suitable for users responsible for providing translations without additional management responsibilities.

## Blocked
