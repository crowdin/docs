With the help of roles, you can provide project members with the access they need to accomplish the job they're responsible for. Both the owner and managers can invite project members and change their roles.

Below you can see the roles and permissions users can have in Crowdin.

## Owner

A person who created a project and has complete control over it. The owner can invite and manage project members, create projects, upload source and translation files to the project, set up integrations, etc.

<Aside>
  Project ownership can't be changed.
</Aside>

## Manager

Manager has similar rights as a project owner except the ability to manage some of the owner's Resources (e.g., configuring MT engines, etc.) and delete projects.

## Language Coordinator

Language Coordinator can manage certain features of a project only within languages they have access to. Language coordinators can translate and approve strings, manage project members and join requests, generate project reports, create tasks, and pre-translate the project content. Unlike managers, they do not have access to other project settings (e.g., project files, integrations, etc.).

## Developer

Developer —Åan upload files, edit translatable text, connect integrations, and use the API. Cannot manage project tasks, members and reports.

## Proofreader

## Translator

Translator can translate strings and vote for translations added by other members.

## Blocked
