Roles in Crowdin define the level of access and control users have within the platform. By assigning roles, you can manage user permissions across the Editor, project settings, and resources.

Below you can find descriptions of each role and the permissions associated with it.

## Owner

Owner is a person who created a project and has complete control over it. The owner can invite users to the project and manage their access, manage resources like AI providers, MT engines and more, upload source and translation files to the project, set up integrations, etc.

<Aside>
  Project ownership can't be changed.

## Manager

Manager has similar rights to the project owner and is responsible for managing their assigned projects. Within these projects, they can manage project members, tasks, resources, and more, but they cannot manage some of the owner's resources (e.g., configuration of AI providers, MT engines, etc.) and cannot delete projects.

**Use case:** Suitable for trusted team members who need full access to manage projects without the ability to delete them.

## Language Coordinator

Language Coordinator can manage certain features of a project only within their assigned languages. Language Coordinators can translate and approve strings, manage project members and join requests, generate project reports, create tasks, and pre-translate the project content. Unlike managers, they cannot access other project settings (e.g., project files, integrations, etc.).

**Use case:** Suitable for users responsible for managing translation within specific project languages.

## Developer

Developer —Åan upload files, edit translatable text, connect integrations, and use the API. Cannot manage project tasks, members, and reports.

**Use case:** Best suits for users focused on the technical implementation of projects, such as integration setup, file management, etc.

## Proofreader

Proofreader can translate and approve strings within the projects they are assigned to. Proofreaders do not have access to project settings.

**Use case:** Suitable for users focused on ensuring translation quality and accuracy.

## Translator

Translator can translate strings and vote on translations added by other members. Translators do not have the ability to approve strings or access project settings.

**Use case:** Suitable for users who are responsible for providing translations within a project but do not require additional permissions or access.

## Blocked

Blocked users don't have access to the project.
