You can invite people to your project via the **Members** tab. The available roles include Manager, Developer, Language Coordinator, Proofreader, and Translator. For the Translator, Proofreader, and Language Coordinator roles, you can optionally limit access to specific target languages. If no languages are selected, the invitee will have access to all target languages in the project.

The invitation process has different implications depending on your project's visibility. For **Private projects**, [Moderated project joining](/project-settings/privacy-collaboration/#privacy) is enabled by default, which means all member access to languages is managed upon invitation. For **Public projects**, you can decide whether to enable this setting.

There are two main methods of involving people in the project:

* Email or username invitation
* Sharing invitation links

<Aside type="caution" title="Limitations">
  The daily limit for inviting users is 1,000 per account for the Proofreader and Translator roles, and 50 per account for the Manager role.
</Aside>

## Email or Username Invitation

To invite people via email or Crowdin username, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to the **Members** tab.
  2. Click **Invite**. <Image src={inviteDialogEmail} alt="Invite dialog" class="width-lg crowdin-modal" />
  3. In the **Invite People** dialog, click the role title to open the **Select role** dialog.
  4. In the **Select role** dialog, select the desired role. For the Translator, Proofreader, or Language Coordinator roles, you can select specific target languages or leave the field empty to allow access to all.
     <Aside title="Managing Language Access">
       If you grant a translator access to **All languages** in a project where **Moderated project joining** is disabled, they will be able to join any other language team in the project later without requiring your approval. To require your approval for all language access changes, enable **Moderated project joining** in your project's [Privacy & Collaboration](/project-settings/privacy-collaboration/#privacy) settings.
     </Aside>
  5. Click **Save** to confirm your selection. <Image src={selectRoleDialog} alt="Select role dialog" class="width-lg crowdin-modal" />
  6. In the **Invite People** dialog, enter the emails or Crowdin usernames of the people you want to invite.
  7. *(Optional)* Customize the message your invitees will receive.
  8. Click **Invite**.
</Steps>

## Sharing Invitation Link

To invite people via invitation link, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to the **Members** tab.
  2. Click **Invite**.
  3. Configure the preferred role and language access as described in the [Email or Username Invitation](#email-or-username-invitation) section.
  4. In the **Invite People** dialog, click **Get Link**.
  5. *(Optional)* Click the arrow next to **Get Link** to configure additional settings:
     * **Link Expiration** &ndash; Choose how long the invitation link will remain active (One hour, One day, One week, One month, or One year).
     * **Short URL** &ndash; Enable this option to generate a more compact invitation link.
  6. Share the copied link with the person you want to invite. <Image src={inviteDialog} alt="Invite dialog" class="width-lg crowdin-modal" />
</Steps>

## Managing Invitation Links

To view and manage previously generated invitation links, click **Manage Links** in the **Invite People** dialog.

In the **Manage links** dialog, you can:

* View each linkâ€™s creation and expiration date
* See the role assigned to the link (e.g., Translator, Language Coordinator)
* Copy the link using the <Icon name="mdi:link" class="inline-icon" />copy icon
* Revoke any link by clicking **Revoke link**

Once revoked, a link immediately becomes inactive and can no longer be used to join the project.
