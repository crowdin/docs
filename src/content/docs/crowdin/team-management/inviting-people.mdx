You can invite members to your project via the **Members** tab. When inviting new people, you can assign them the following roles: Manager, Language Coordinator, Developer, Proofreader, and Translator. For the Translator, Proofreader, and Language Coordinator roles, you can specify the project's target languages a member should have access to or leave empty for access to all languages.
