With the help of roles, you can provide project members with the access they need to accomplish the job they're responsible for. Both the owner and managers can invite project members and change their roles.

## Changing Role

To change the role of a project member, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to the **Members** tab.
  1. Click **Details** toward a needed member in the list.
  1. In the appeared dialog, switch to the **Permissions** tab.
  1. Select a new role.
  1. Click **Save**. <Image src={changeMemberRole} alt="Changing Member Role" class="width-xl" />
</Steps>

## Languages Permissions

By default, when you invite translators to your project, they will have access to all target languages.

To configure more specific access to target languages for your translators, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Open your project and go to the **Members** tab.
  1. Click **Details** toward a needed member in the list.
  1. In the appeared dialog, switch to the **Permissions** tab.
  1. Select the needed languages a member should have access to. You can simultaneously set both the **Translator** and **Proofreader** roles to the same member with specific language permissions (e.g., Translator with access to Ukrainian and Proofreader with access to French).
  1. Click **Save**. <Image src={configureLanguagePermissions} alt="Configuring Language Permissions" class="width-xl" />
</Steps>

## Q&A

<QuestionAnswer open title="I'm a project owner. Do I need to invite a manager or a proofreader?">
  The main difference between a manager and a proofreader is the following: in addition to approving translations added by translators, managers can also invite and remove project members, upload source and translation files to the project, set up integrations, etc.

  If you want to have a project member who should have access to the features mentioned above, you need to invite a project manager. Alternatively, if you plan to manage the project yourself, it will be enough to invite a proofreader.
