You can configure verbal expressions and custom placeholders using a shared set of expression syntax elements. These elements define how specific parts of a string should be matched, based on structure, character types, or formatting patterns.

## Verbal Expressions

In the Editor, you can use verbal expressions in the [Advanced Filter](/online-editor/#advanced-filter) to search for strings that match specific patterns, similar to regular expressions. You can use it to filter strings based on patterns like punctuation, character types, length, and more.

For example, to find all strings that start with an uppercase letter and end with a period, use the following expression:

```graphql
start "true", range "A,Z", anything, range "a,z,A,Z,0,9", limit "1,50", then ".", end "true"
```

This expression means:
- `start "true"` – the string begins at the start
- `range "A,Z"` – starts with a capital letter
- `anything` – followed by any characters
- `range "a,z,A,Z,0,9"` – allows letters and numbers
- `limit "1,50"` – string length between 1 and 50 characters
- `then "."` – ends with a period
- `end "true"` – end of the string

<Aside type="caution">
  When you enable verbal expressions, you can't use the regular string search at the same time.

### Verbal Expression Examples

Below are several examples of verbal expressions along with the types of strings they help match in your project. These are useful when you want to filter strings with specific content or structure.

<Aside>
  All the examples below use the same argument delimiter `"`
</Aside>

##### Start with Uppercase and End with a Period

String example:

```
A test string.
```

Expression:

```graphql
start "true", range "A,Z", anything, range "a,z,A,Z,0,9", limit "1,50", then ".", end "true"
```

##### Strings Containing URLs

String example:

```
Visit http://example.com or https://www.example.com
```

Expression:

```graphql
then "http", maybe "s", then "://", maybe "www.", anythingbut " "
```

##### Strings with `%s` and `%d` Placeholders

String example:

```
Welcome, %s! You have %d new messages.
```

Expression:

```graphql
then "%", anyof "s,d"
```

##### Strings with Variables in Double Curly Brackets

String example:

```
Hello, {{user.name}}!
```

Expression:

```graphql
then "{{", range "a,z", multiple, then ".", range "a,z", multiple, then "}}"
```

<Aside>
  This expression matches variables like `{{user.name}}` where both parts contain only lowercase letters.
</Aside>

##### Strings with Variables in Double Curly Brackets (Including Uppercase Letters and Digits)

String example:

```
Hello, {{User123.name42}}!
```

Expression:

```graphql
then "{{", range "a,z,A,Z,0,9", multiple, then ".", range "a,z,A,Z,0,9", multiple, then "}}"
```

<Aside>
  Use this version to match variables where names can contain uppercase letters or numbers.
</Aside>

##### Strings That Contain Floating Point Numbers

String example:

```
The result is 3.14159
```

Expression:

```graphql
start, range "0,9", multiple, then ".", range "0,9", multiple, end
```

##### Strings That Start with Title Case (Two Capitalized Words)

String example:

```
Quick Access is available now.
```

Expression:

```graphql
start, range "A,Z", range "a,z", multiple, then " ", range "A,Z", range "a,z", multiple
```

##### Strings with Trailing Whitespace

String example:

```
This is a sentence with trailing space 
```

Expression:

```graphql
start "true", range "A,Z", anything, range "a,z,A,Z,0,9", then " ", end "true"
```

##### Strings Starting with a Hash Symbol (e.g., Hashtags or Anchors)

String example:

```
#GettingStarted
```

Expression:

```graphql
start "true", then "#", something, end "true"
```

##### Strings Containing HTML Tags

String example:

```
Click <strong>here</strong> to continue.
```

Expression:

```graphql
then "<", something, then ">"
```

##### Strings Containing an Email Address Format

String example:

```
Please contact us at support@example.com
```

Expression:

```graphql
then "@", somethingbut " "
```

##### Strings with Double Spaces (Possible Spacing Issue)

String example:

```
This  string has extra space.
```

Expression:

```graphql
then "  "
```

##### Strings Ending with a Colon

String example:

```
Enter your name:
```

Expression:

```graphql
then ":", end "true"
```

##### Strings with a Currency Symbol Followed by Digits

String example:

```
Total: $29.99
```

Expression:

```graphql
then "$", range "0,9", multiple
```

##### Strings in camelCase Format

String example:

```

```

Expression:

```graphql
start, range "a,z", multiple, range "A,Z", range "a,z", multiple, end
```
