The Editor is the main place in Crowdin where project members can work on translations. It allows users to suggest, vote on, review, and approve translations online.

Using the Main menu <Icon name="mdi:menu" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-left corner, you can switch between files for translation, change translation languages, contact a manager, change the view, and access help materials.

## Core Features

The Editor provides all the necessary tools for translators and proofreaders, including:

* List of strings available for translation, which may vary in different [Editor modes](#editor-modes).
* Context, labels, and additional information to guide the work.
* String search and filtering options for efficient translation management.
* [AI Assistant](/crowdin-ai/#using-ai-in-the-editor), [Translation Memory (TM)](/translation-memory/) suggestions, and [Machine Translation (MT)](/machine-translation/) suggestions.
* [Glossary](/glossary/) terms to ensure consistency.
* Comments section for collaboration and reporting issues.

<Image src={sbsEditor} alt="Side-by-side Editor mode" />

### String List

This section displays the list of strings, with the active one highlighted. Strings are text elements that are either individual words, phrases, or sentences. Some strings might have replacement tokens (e.g., {0}, {1}, %1, etc.) or elements of the [ICU message syntax](/icu-message-syntax/). Such items themselves should not be translated but are used by the website code to dynamically insert some information into strings. To work with such strings, you should copy the source string and translate only the real words.

Strings can have the following statuses:

- <Icon name="untranslated" size="24" class="inline-icon align-middle" /> - untranslated
- <Icon name="partially-translated" size="24" class="inline-icon align-middle" /> - partially translated (if some of the plural forms are not translated)
- <Icon name="translated" size="24" class="inline-icon align-middle" /> - translated
- <Icon name="partially-approved" size="24" class="inline-icon align-middle" /> - partially approved (if some plural forms are not approved)
- <Icon name="approved" size="24" class="inline-icon align-middle" /> - approved
- <Icon name="hidden" size="24" class="inline-icon align-middle" /> - hidden (visible only for project managers and proofreaders)

There also might be the following icons besides strings:

- <Icon name="mdi:comment-outline" class="inline-icon" /> - the string has comments from contributors
- <Icon name="mdi:comment-alert-outline" class="inline-icon" /> - the string has an unresolved issue
- <Icon name="mdi:tag-outline" class="inline-icon" /> - the string has labels

#### Suggesting Translations

To suggest a translation, select a string from the list and enter your suggestion in the field next to the original text. When you're done, click **Save**. Your suggestion will be added to the string's translation suggestions list, and you'll automatically move on to the next string.

<Image src={suggestingTranslations} alt="Suggesting Translations" />

#### Proofreading

Review the translations to make sure they are ready for export, and click *Approve* <Icon name="mdi:check" class="inline-icon" /> icon next to the suggestion to approve each translation separately.

To approve all or a couple of the strings at once, check the boxes on the left and then click **Approve**.

<Image src={multiApprove} alt="Side-by-Side Proofreading" />

<Aside>
  Make sure to enable [QA checks](/project-settings/qa-checks/) to help you find strings that require review. Issues found will be highlighted in red under the translated strings that require revision.
</Aside>

<Image src={qaChecksOn} alt="QA issues" />

#### WYSIWYG File Preview

When translating the content of an HTML, XML, TXT, DOCX, XLSX, HAML, Web XML, Markdown, MDX, DITA, Wiki, ADOC, Coffee, FTL, JS, TS, and FTLH file formats, you can toggle a bottom panel (for Side-by-side and Multilingual modes) to see a file preview (i.e., WYSIWYG). For Comfortable mode, the file preview is displayed by default when working with the formats mentioned above.

The string status is indicated by the following colors:

- Red - untranslated
- Blue - translated
- Light-green - approved
- Gray - not for translation

An active string is highlighted in yellow.

<Image src={htmlPreview} alt="HTML view" />

The following options are available to manage the above view:

- <Icon name="mdi:format-list-bulleted" class="inline-icon" /> - *Load basic list view*. Use it to switch to a standard mode and see a list of strings (Comfortable mode only).
- <Icon name="material-symbols:format-ink-highlighter" class="inline-icon" /> - *Highlight untranslated, translated, and approved strings*. Use it to toggle the color highlighting of strings on and off.
- <Icon name="mdi:eye" class="inline-icon" /> - *Show translation preview*. Use it to toggle the translation preview mode on and off.
- <Icon name="mdi:magnify-plus" class="inline-icon" /> - *Scale Toggle*. Use it to toggle between a zoomed-in and zoomed-out view (Comfortable mode only).

#### String Search

You can search for strings by source text, translations, context, or all at once. Depending on the content you open in the Editor, the system will search for matches within the currently open file or across all strings in the project.

To search for strings in the file or the whole project, type your search phrase in the *Search in file* (*Search strings*) field. You can also use a keyboard shortcut to switch to the search field (by default, <KBD>Ctrl</KBD>+<KBD>F</KBD>).

To refine the search results, you can use the following options:

* *Match case* &ndash; with this option, you will find only the strings written in the same case: for example, if you search for `Work` and select *Match case*, the system will find `Work`, `Works`, `Working` but not `work`.
* *Match whole phrase* &ndash; with this option, you will find the strings containing the search phrase only in the original order: for example, if you search for `Machine Translation` and select *Match whole phrase*, the system will find `Machine Translation`, `Machine translation`, `machine translation` but not `Translation Machine`. When *Match whole phrase* is not selected, the system splits the search phrase into separate words and searches for matches in the strings in any order.
* *Exact match* &ndash; with this option, you will find only the strings that exactly match the search phrase: for example, if you search for `Work` and select *Exact match*, the system will find `Work`, `work`, but not `Works` or `Working`.

You can combine *Match case* with *Exact match* and *Match case* with *Match whole phrase*. *Match whole phrase* and *Exact match* are mutually exclusive options.

The search phrase is limited to 128 characters. If you use a search phrase longer than 128 characters, it is automatically truncated to the maximum allowed.

To search for strings by a numeric identifier, type the number without quotation marks, such as *34354*, to find the exact match.
To search for the occurrences of the number in the text or context, enclose the number in quotation marks when typing it in the search box, for example: "34354".

<Image src={stringSearch} alt="String Search" />

#### Filtering Strings

To filter the strings displayed in the left sidebar, click <Icon name="mdi:filter-variant" class="inline-icon" /> and select the preferred filter option.

Available filter options:

* *Show All* &ndash; Show all strings from the open file/folder in their original order.
* *All, Untranslated First* &ndash; Show all strings from the opened file/folder. Untranslated strings are displayed at the top of the list, followed by translated strings, and then approved ones are displayed at the bottom of the list.
* *Untranslated* &ndash; Show only strings without any translations.
* *Need to Be Voted* &ndash; Show already translated strings.
* *Not Approved* &ndash; Show strings that are already translated but not yet approved by a proofreader.
* *Approved* &ndash; Show only strings with approved translations.
* *QA issues* &ndash; Show strings with no QA issues or with unresolved QA issues in the current language.
* *Machine Translation* &ndash; Show strings that are translated by TM or MT suggestions without changes. Often these strings require additional review.
* *With Comments* &ndash; Show strings that have comments.
* *With Unresolved Issues* &ndash; Show strings with unresolved issues in the current language or all languages.
* *Hidden* &ndash; Show strings that are hidden from translators. Strings can be hidden by project managers or automatically hidden by Crowdin when they are marked as duplicates.
* *Advanced Filter* &ndash; A filter that allows you to configure custom filtering and sorting parameters.
* *AI/CroQL Filter* &ndash; An AI-powered filter that allows you to create custom queries using the [Crowdin Query Language (CroQL)](/developer/croql/) for enhanced string filtering.

<Aside type="caution" title="Permissions">
  Some of the filter options may be available only to project members with manager permissions (or higher).
</Aside>

<Image src={stringsFilter} alt="Strings Filter" />

##### Verbal Expressions

The Verbal Expression section of the Advanced Filter implements a regular expression search. You can set specific search parameters for strings in your project. For example, you can search for all strings that begin with uppercase letters and have no periods at the end or contain a date.

For example, if you want to extract all strings that start with an uppercase letter and have a period at the end, your expression might look like this: `start "true", range "A,Z", anything, range "a,z,A,Z,0,9", limit "1,50", then ".", end "true"`

Let's break down the above expression:

`start "true"` &ndash; indicates the beginning of the string.
`range "A,Z"` &ndash; means that your string starts with characters in the range A-Z.
`range "a,z,A,Z,0,9"` &ndash; means that your string can contain characters in the range a-z and/or A-Z and/or 0-9.
`limit "1,50"` &ndash; means that the length of the string is between 1 and 50 characters.
`then "."` &ndash; means that your string ends with a period.
`end "true"` &ndash; indicates the end of the string.

Here are some other use case examples of how you can use Verbal Expressions:

* Strings containing URLs: `then "http", maybe "s", then "://", maybe "www.", anythingbut " "`
* Strings with `%s` and `%d` placeholders: `then "%", anyof "s,d"`
* Strings with variables enclosed in double curly brackets: `then "{{", range "a,z", then ".", range "a,z", then "}}"`
* Strings that contain a floating point number: `start, range "0,9", multiple, then ".", range "0,9", multiple, end`

<Aside type="caution">
  When you enable verbal expressions, you can't use the regular string search.
</Aside>

### Plural Forms

Some strings may have plural forms. Depending on the language, the number of plural forms may vary. For example, Chinese has one plural form, English has two plural forms, and other languages may have up to six plural forms. Crowdin works with plural forms according to the CLDR Language Plural Rules.

<ReadMore>
  Read more about [CLDR Language Plural Rules](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/language_plural_rules.html).
</ReadMore>

If a string has multiple plural forms, all variants of the string are displayed in the section where you type in translations. Enter translations in the appropriate sections that display the plural forms of the target language.

<Image src={pluralForms} alt="Plural forms" />

### QA Checks

You might also get automatic Quality Assurance (QA) check pop-up messages to avoid some translation inaccuracy. For example, you can see notifications about inconsistency in punctuation, space mismatch, missing variables, and more.

<Image src={qaPopUp} alt="QA pop-up" />

### String Menu

Clicking <Icon name="mdi:dots-vertical" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-right allows you to:

* **Remove Approval** &ndash; Remove the approval for a translation, reverting its status to unapproved. (Available for proofreaders or higher.)
* **Remove Translation** &ndash; Clear translations for the selected strings along with the associated TM records. Duplicate translations from master strings remain unaffected.
* **Hide/Make Visible** &ndash; Toggle the visibility of a string for translators. Hidden strings are accessible only to project managers or higher.
* **Pre-translate** &ndash; Initiate [pre-translation](#pre-translation-in-the-editor) directly in the Editor using Translation Memory (TM), Machine Translation (MT), or AI.
* **Copy String URL** &ndash; Access a specific string using its unique link or share it with colleagues.
* **Copy Source Skeleton** &ndash; Copy untranslatable elements to the translation section. Useful when translating strings with ICU message syntax or HTML tags.
* **Clear Selected Input** &ndash; Clear the translation field for the selected string.
* **Translation History** &ndash; View all the modifications made to the string.
* **View String In Context** &ndash; Display the string along with other strings surrounding it in the source file, helping you understand its context better.
* **Labels** &ndash; Add or manage labels assigned to the string, helping to categorize or identify it for specific purposes.
* **Max. Length** &ndash; View and edit the maximum character length allowed for the string translation. Clicking this option opens a modal with the following settings:
  * **Proportional to source texts** &ndash; Set the maximum length as a percentage of the source text length. Use the slider or manually enter a percentage (e.g., 100%, 150%, 200%) to define the limit.
  * **Fixed max. length** &ndash; Specify an absolute character limit for the string translation.
  * **Unlimited** &ndash; Allow translations of any length without restrictions.
* **Delete String** &ndash; Permanently remove the string from the project. (Available to project members with manager permissions or higher.)

<Aside type="caution" title="Permissions">
  Some of the string menu options may be available only to project members with manager permissions (or higher).
</Aside>

In the translation window, you will also see the *Maximum length of translation* limit if it’s exceeded.

<Image src={stringMenu} alt="String Menu" />

Additional action buttons available when translating a string:

- <Icon name="copy-source" class="inline-icon dark:invert" /> - _Copy Source_. Use it to keep the initial string structure while translating messages with replacement tokens or elements of ICU message syntax.
- <Icon name="mdi:delete-outline" class="inline-icon" /> - _Clear_. Use it when you need to clear the translation field quickly. Alternatively, use the *Clear Selected Input* option from the string menu.
- <Icon name="mdi:form-textbox" class="inline-icon" /> - _Text selection mode_. Use it when you want to copy a part of the translation from Translation Memory (TM) or Machine Translations (MT) (Comfortable mode only).

### Context and Translations

This section contains the resources that might be useful:

- Context, labels, screenshots, and additional information to guide the work.
- Translations by other project participants
- Translation Memory (TM) suggestions
- Machine Translation (MT) suggestions
- Translations to other languages

Click on one of the suggestions, and it will automatically appear in the translation field. Refer to it as a basis for your own suggestions.

To quickly copy the TM or MT suggestion to the translation field and save it, click **Use and Save** <Icon name="mdi:content-save" class="inline-icon" /> on the desired suggestion.

*Other Languages* section allows you to check the string translations into other target languages. This can be a useful tip for multilingual people and while translating dialects of a language.

<Image src={otherLanguagesTab} alt="Other languages" />

#### Voting

If you see that there is already a correct suggestion, vote for it by clicking the *plus* <Icon name="mdi:plus" class="inline-icon" /> sign if you like the translation, or the *minus* <Icon name="mdi:minus" class="inline-icon" /> sign if you don't think the translation is correct. Translations that receive the most positive votes will have a higher rating and will appear at the top of all available translations for the string.

<Image src={vote} alt="Vote" />

#### Requesting Context

Within the **Context & Translations** section, you can find the context for each string, which may include technical details, a description of where the string appears in the product, or a screenshot showing its location in the user interface. If a string lacks context and its meaning is unclear, click **Request** to notify a project manager that additional explanation is needed.

<Image src={requestContext} alt="Request context" />

### Comments

Using the *Comments* section, you can discuss the meaning of the source string or other related questions. It is recommended to use a source language of the project so other translators can understand it. Use "@" and a username to direct your message to the specific person.

You can also use this section to report problems with source strings or translations, ask questions, or request additional context.

<Image src={commentNew} alt="Comment" />

<LinkCard
  title="Issues"
  description="Learn how to report and manage translation issues in the Editor."
  href="/issues/"
/>

### Search TM

Using the *Search TM* section, you can check for all the available translations from [Translation Memory](/translation-memory/), which is the vault of translations uploaded to the system by project managers.

The Search TM section provides the following options:

* Source &ndash; Search for matches in a source language.
* Target &ndash; Search for matches in target languages.
* Guess translation &ndash; Highlight probable translation of a search phrase.
* Numeric equivalence &ndash; Match digits from a search phrase with any other digits.

Additionally, to maximize your search results, you can use the following wildcards with your search phrase:

Type an asterisk **(\*)** to find words where the end or beginning may be different.
Example: any* finds *any*, *anyway*, *anything*
Example: \*way finds *way*, *anyway*, *highway*

Type a plus sign **(+)** to find words where the end or beginning must be different.
Example: any+ finds *anyway*, *anything*, *anywhere*, except *any*
Example: +way finds *anyway*, *highway*, *someway*, except *way*

Type a minus sign **(-)** to exclude words from your search.
Example: Save -as

Use quotation marks to find the exact combination of words.
Example: "Save as"

<Image src={searchTm} alt="Search TM" />

### Editing TM Suggestions in the Editor

When working in the Editor, you can view the TM suggestions displayed in the TM and MT Suggestions section and in the right sidebar found through the Search TM section. There may be situations where TM suggestions contain inaccuracies or need to be updated.

Project members with manager permissions (or higher) can edit or delete TM records directly in the Editor, both in the TM and MT Suggestions section and in the Search TM section, rather than having to go to the Translation Memories page in the Resources or Project Settings. This ensures that TM suggestions are updated safely and quickly, improving the overall quality of the TM.

To edit the TM suggestion, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Click <Icon name="mdi:pencil" class="inline-icon" /> in the TM and MT Suggestions section or **Edit** in the Search TM section. <Image src={editTmSuggestions} alt="Edit TM Suggestions" />
  2. In the appeared dialog, make the necessary edits (i.e., modify or delete) to the TM suggestions for each language present in the TM segment.
  3. To revert accidental deletions or unwanted changes, click **Undo** next to the TM suggestions or click **Cancel** to revert all modifications before saving.
  4. Once the desired edits are completed, click **Save** to confirm and apply these changes to the TM segment.
</Steps>

To completely delete a TM segment from the TM, delete all TM records across all languages and click **Save**.

### Terms

Underlined words or phrases in strings indicate project-specific terminology, which should be translated according to the provided term description. You can view detailed explanations by hovering over the underlined text or visiting the Terms section.

The Terms section allows you to browse the project glossary (if available) and search for specific terms. If a term is not found in the glossary, Wikipedia explanations will be displayed as a reference.

Some terms may already have translations, which help maintain consistency across the project. To reuse a translated term, simply click on the underlined text, and its translation will automatically appear in the translation field.

<Image src={terms} alt="Terms" />

### File Context

The *File Context* section allows you to provide translators with additional details to help them understand how to translate a specific file. File context can be added as plain text or Markdown, either directly in the Editor or through the [File Settings](/file-management/#file-context) by the project members with manager permissions (or higher). For other project members, file context is read-only.

To add file context in the Editor, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Click **Add File Context** in the File Context section.
  1. Add the context or instructions for your translators. You can use either plain text or Markdown.
  1. *(Optional)* Click **Preview** to see how the text will appear after saving.
  1. Click **Save**.
</Steps>

To edit file context, click the existing text in the File Context section, make your changes, and click **Save**.

<Image src={fileContext} alt="File context" />

## Editor Modes

The Editor offers several viewing modes to accommodate different translation workflows. The available modes include **Side-by-Side**, **Comfortable**, and **Multilingual**, each providing a unique layout for presenting and managing translations. The **Side-by-Side** mode is enabled by default, but you can easily switch as needed.

You can switch between Editor modes using the following methods:

- **Via Main menu** &ndash; click on the **Main menu** <Icon name="mdi:menu" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-left corner, select **View**, and choose the preferred mode.
- **Via Editor View icon** &ndash; click the **Editor View** icon in the upper-right corner and choose the preferred mode.

### Side-by-Side Mode

Side-by-Side mode, detailed in the [Core Features](#core-features) section, is ideal for managing multiple translations at once. Translators can work on several strings simultaneously or swiftly review and vote on existing translations. Managers and proofreaders can efficiently approve the best options all within the same view.

### Comfortable Mode

Comfortable mode allows translators and proofreaders to focus on one string at a time, ensuring accuracy without distractions. It emphasizes the active string, making it easier to review context and related resources. This mode is ideal for handling complex translations or performing detailed proofreading, where precision and thoroughness are essential.

The main working area with the source string at the top and the translation section below. To add a translation, you need to select a string from the left section, and it will appear in the middle-top *Source String* field.

<Image src={comfortable} alt="Comfortable Editor Mode" />

### Multilingual Mode

The multilingual mode provides similar features as the side-by-side mode and allows multilingual translators and proofreaders to work with multiple languages at the same time. You can select up to ten languages to work with simultaneously. The right panel shows the string's translations of the language you're entering a translation for or the one that was selected last.

<Image src={multilingualMode} alt="Multilingual Mode" />

Once you switch to the multilingual mode, select the languages you'd like to work with, and click **Apply**. To add new languages or remove some of the earlier selected ones, click on the Main menu <Icon name="mdi:menu" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-left corner, choose **Language**, alternatively click on the **Languages** in the upper-left corner, then do the necessary modifications to the language list and click **Apply**.

When working in multilingual mode, you can switch between two possible views: List View, Grid View.

The List view is enabled by default. To switch to grid view, click <Icon name="mdi:grid" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-left corner.
To adjust the columns displayed in the Grid view, click on the drop-down toggle in the upper-right corner and select the preferred ones.

<Image src={multilingualModeGrid} alt="Multilingual Mode Grid View" />

#### For Proofreaders

The proofreading process works mainly the same way as in side-by-side mode, except when approving or removing approvals for all or a couple of strings at once, the system performs the action for all languages selected for the multilingual mode.

#### Using Filter in Multilingual Mode

When using filter options in multilingual mode, the system will show strings that meet the selected criteria for at least one of the selected languages.

This behavior applies to the following filter options:

* Untranslated
* Not Approved
* Approved
* QA issues
* Machine Translations
* Advanced Filter > Translations updated
* Advanced Filter > Translations > Partially translated (plurals)
* Advanced Filter > Translations > Same as source string
* Advanced Filter > Votes

## Translating RTL Languages

When translating between LTR and RTL languages, some elements in the translation field in the Editor might not be displayed the same way as they will be once exported.

To be sure that RTL translations will be displayed correctly in the exported file, we recommend making translations the following way:

<Steps>
  1. Click <Icon name="copy-source" class="inline-icon dark:invert" /> under the source text (or <KBD>Alt</KBD>+<KBD>C</KBD> key combination).
  2. Translate the source texts into the target language.
  3. Leave variables, tags, etc., unchanged in the translation, even if they look wrong. They will be in the right positions in the exported file.
</Steps>

<Image src={rtlLanguages} alt="Save suggestion for RTL language" />

<Aside type="tip">
  For cases when you need to provide bidirectional translations (e.g., strings with placeholders), we recommend using the [Unicode Table](https://store.crowdin.com/unicode) app, with the help of which you can copy and paste right-to-left and left-to-right marks to the translation field, changing the direction of text where needed.
</Aside>

## Command Palette

The Command Palette in the Editor is your hub for accessing various commands efficiently. It serves as a central location for all available commands, ensuring a seamless and intuitive experience.

To open the Command Palette, click <Icon name="material-symbols:terminal" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-right corner.

<Image src={commandPalette} alt="Command Palette" class="dialog width-xl" />

## Managing Unsaved Translations

When you enter translations but haven't saved them, a green indicator appears next to the <Icon name="mdi:playlist-edit" class="inline-icon" />**Unsaved Translations** icon. Hovering over or clicking <Icon name="mdi:playlist-edit" class="inline-icon" /> displays a tooltip with the number of unsaved translations.

This feature offers the following options:

- Check the number of unsaved translations.
- Save all unsaved translations with a single click.
- View and manage all strings with unsaved translations.

To view unsaved translations, click <Icon name="mdi:playlist-edit" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-right corner and select **View Strings**. Alternatively, click <Icon name="mdi:filter-variant" class="inline-icon" /> and select **Unsaved translations**.

Once filtered, you can continue editing unsaved translations. If they are ready to be saved, click **Save All** to apply the changes.

## Editor Settings

To open the Editor settings, click <Icon name="mdi:cog" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-right corner.

The Editor settings are grouped into tabs that contain various options for configuring the Editor according to your preferences.

### General

- *Translation Memory Suggestions* &ndash; you can specify the minimum similarity match (in percentages) for translation memory suggestions shown under the translation field.
- *QA issues* &ndash; if enabled, the pop-up messages with warnings will appear each time you try to save a translation with some inaccuracy (punctuation/tags/spaces mismatch, missing variables, etc.)
  <Image src={qaPopUp} alt="QA pop-up" />
- *Auto-complete* &ndash; if enabled, the pop-up with translation prediction and automatic translation completion will appear while you type the translation.
- *Auto-approve* &ndash; if enabled, the translations added by proofreaders or members with higher permissions are automatically approved.
- *Automatically move to next string* &ndash; if enabled, you'll be automatically moved to the next string after saving a new translation or approving an existing one.

### AI

The AI tab allows to configure custom prompts and shortcuts for AI Assistant. This tab will appear in the Editor settings once the project owner configures AI provider and sets up the **AI in editor** prompt.

### Translation Progress Indicators

Use translation and approval indicators to monitor the progress of the currently opened file or folder. These indicators display the proportion of content that is translated and approved, allowing you to quickly assess the current status.

There are two types of indicators available in the Editor:

* **Circular Progress Indicators** – Located in the upper-right corner of the toolbar, these show the percentage of translated and approved content for the file or folder you're working on.
* **Detailed Progress Breakdown** – Accessible via the **Main menu > File**, this provides information on the total word count, number of translated, pre-translated, and approved words, along with percentage completion for each.

<Image src={translationProgressIndicators} alt="Translation Progress Indicators" />

<Aside type="tip">
  Translation and approval progress updates automatically every 2 minutes. To refresh progress manually, click the circular progress indicators in the upper-right corner. This also refreshes the progress displayed in **Main menu > File**.
</Aside>

### Context Menu Options for Selected Words

When you select a word or phrase in the source string or translation, the <Icon name="mdi:lightbulb" class="inline-icon" /> icon will appear. Clicking the icon opens a context menu with several useful options:

* **Search TM** &ndash; Look for Translation Memory (TM) suggestions for the selected word or phrase.
* **Search in Terminology and Wikipedia** &ndash; Find an explanation of the selected word or phrase in the project terminology or Wikipedia.
* **Create Term** &ndash; Add the selected word or phrase to the project glossary as a new term.
* **Transform** (only available for selected words in the translation) &ndash; Access a submenu with options to convert the selected text to lowercase or uppercase.
* **Copy** &ndash; Copy the selected word or phrase to clipboard.
* **Copy & Paste** &ndash; Copy the selected word or phrase and immediately paste it into the translation field.

<Aside type="caution" title="Permissions">
  The *Create Term* option availability depends on the [Glossary Access Settings](/project-settings/privacy-collaboration/#glossary-access-settings) configured by the project managers.
</Aside>

### Switching to Another File

To translate strings from the other files, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. Click on the Main menu <Icon name="mdi:menu" class="inline-icon" /> or click on the current file name in the upper-left corner.
  2. Choose **File > Open**.
  3. Select the necessary file and click **Open**. Alternatively, just double-click on the necessary file.
</Steps>

To see all strings of the project, click on the Main menu <Icon name="mdi:menu" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-left corner, and go to **File** > **All Strings**. Alternatively, click on the current file name in the upper-left corner > **All Strings**.

To quickly find and reopen one of the files you recently worked on, click on the Main menu <Icon name="mdi:menu" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-left corner, go to **File** and select the needed file from the **Recent files** section.

### Source and Translated File Preview

In addition to the [WYSIWYG file preview](#wysiwyg-file-preview), which shows files as they would appear when rendered, there are **Source File Preview** and **Translated File Preview** modes that allow users to view the raw content of both source and translated files directly within the Editor. These previews provide insight into the file's structure, layout, and formatting, helping users ensure accurate translations within the correct context. This is particularly helpful for identifying discrepancies or formatting issues without leaving the Editor. While the **Translated File Preview** is available to all users, the **Source File Preview** is restricted to members with Developer permissions or higher.

To open a file in either of these previews, click on the Main menu <Icon name="mdi:menu" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-left corner, go to **File**, and select the needed file preview mode.

### Replace in Suggested Translations

You can easily find and replace suggested translations using the *Replace in Translations* feature.

To replace previously added translations with the new ones, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. In the project *Dashboard* tab, select the necessary language.
  2. Click **Translate All** or choose a file for translation.
  3. Click on the Main menu <Icon name="mdi:menu" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-left corner.
  4. Go to **File** > **Replace in Translations**.
  5. Enter the word, phrase, or sentence you want to substitute and the text to replace it with. Similarly to [string search](#string-search), you can use the *Match case* and *Exact match* options to refine the search results.
  6. From the drop-down menu, specify the scope of your search, selecting between *File*, *All files*, or *Filtered strings* options.
  7. Click **Find** to preview the strings that will be replaced. <Image src={replaceInSuggestionsResults} alt="Find and Replace results" class="width-xl" />
  8. *(Optional)* Click the *Settings* drop-down menu on the right and select what information to display in the search results other than translations. You can choose between *Key*, *Context*, and *Source*.
  9. Select the translations you want to replace and click **Replace Selected** to finish.
</Steps>

While translators can perform replacements only in their own translations, project members with proofreader permissions (or higher) can modify all suggested translations. Authorship of translations is preserved.

### Replace in Sources

Project members with developer permissions (or higher) can find and replace source texts using the *Replace in Sources* feature.

To replace source texts, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. In the project *Dashboard* tab, select the necessary language.
  2. Click **Translate All** or choose a file for translation.
  3. Click on the Main menu <Icon name="mdi:menu" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-left corner.
  4. Go to **File** > **Replace in Sources**.
  5. Enter the word, phrase, or sentence you want to substitute and the text to replace it with. Similarly to [string search](#string-search), you can use the *Match case* and *Exact match* options to refine the search results.
  6. From the drop-down menu, specify the scope of your search, selecting between *File*, *All files*, or *Filtered strings* options.
  7. Click **Find** to preview the strings that will be replaced. <Image src={replaceInSourcesResults} alt="Find and Replace results" class="width-xl" />
  8. *(Optional)* Click the *Settings* drop-down menu on the right and select what information to display in the search results other than strings. You can choose between *Key* and *Context*.
  9. In the lower-left corner, click the drop-down menu and select the preferred behavior for the translations of the source strings to be replaced. You can choose between *Keep Translations*, *Remove Approvals*, or *Delete Translations*.
  10. Select the source strings you want to replace and click **Replace Selected** to finish.
</Steps>

### Pre-translation in the Editor

The **Pre-translation** feature in the Editor allows you to apply translations to multiple strings directly within the Editor using Translation Memory (TM), Machine Translation (MT), or AI. This feature is available to project members with language coordinator permissions or higher.

To apply Pre-translation in the Editor, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  1. You can apply pre-translation in the Editor in two ways:
      * **Main menu** &ndash; click on the Main menu <Icon name="mdi:menu" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-left corner, go to **File** and select the preferred pre-translation method.
      * **String menu** (available in **Side-by-Side** and **Multilingual** modes) &ndash; click <Icon name="mdi:dots-vertical" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-right and select the preferred pre-translation method.
  2. Configure the following pre-translation parameters:
      * **Scope** – select which strings to apply pre-translation to:
        * **Selected strings** (Specific to **Side-by-Side** and **Multilingual** modes) – applies only to strings manually selected in the Editor.
        * **Filtered strings** – applies to all strings matching the current filter.
        * **File** – applies to the currently opened file.
        * **All files** – applies to all strings across all files in the project, regardless of the file currently open in the Editor.
      * **Apply to untranslated strings only** – when selected, pre-translation will only be applied to strings that don’t have any translations.
      * **Allow duplicate translations** – adds translations even if they duplicate existing ones. Useful when comparing AI prompts or MT engines in the [Pre-translation Accuracy](/project-reports/#pre-translation-accuracy) report, as it ensures that all translations are registered as new and included in accuracy calculations.
        <Aside>
          **Apply to untranslated strings only** and **Allow duplicate translations** are mutually exclusive. Only one of them can be selected at a time.
        </Aside>
      * **Minimum match ratio** (Specific to pre-translation via TM) - select either **100%** or **Perfect match (101%)** as the minimum similarity required for TM matches.
        <ReadMore>
          Read more about [TM Match Types](/translation-memory/#tm-match-calculation).
        </ReadMore>
      * **Skip approved translations** (Specific to pre-translation via TM and MT) – prevents overwriting strings that already have approved translations.
      * **Approve added translations** (Specific to pre-translation via TM) – allows you to auto-approve translations added through pre-translation. Options include:
        * **All** – approve all added translations.
        * **With perfect match** – approve only those with a 101% match.
        * **With perfect match (approved previously)** – approve perfect matches only if they were already approved before.
        * **All (skip auto-substituted translations)** – approve everything except translations improved by auto-substitution.
      * **Translation engine** (Specific to pre-translation via MT) – select the machine translation engine to use.
      * **AI prompt** (Specific to pre-translation via AI) – select the prompt that will guide the AI model’s behavior during pre-translation.
  3. Click **Pre-Translation**.
</Steps>

In Side-by-side and Comfortable modes, pre-translation is applied to the single language currently selected in the Editor. In Multilingual mode, translations are applied across all selected languages, as this mode allows working with multiple languages simultaneously.

### Advanced Filter

You can create a custom filter of strings by clicking the *Filter strings* <Icon name="mdi:filter-variant" class="inline-icon" /> icon and choosing *Advanced Filter*.

You can choose multiple filter parameters (e.g., strings added, strings updated, translations updated, [Labels](/project-settings/labels/), and more) based on your specific needs to sort the strings. This might help to find the necessary information much faster.

In the below screenshot, you may see the strings are filtered by *Translations updated* interval, the *Labels* that the filtered strings should be marked with, the *Comments*, *Visibility*, and *Approved by* parameters as well as sorted by *Alphabet* in *Descending* order.

<Image src={advancedFilter} alt="Advanced Filter" />

### AI/CroQL Filter

The AI/CroQL Filter allows you to filter strings similarly to the Advanced Filter but offers greater flexibility through the Crowdin Query Language (CroQL).

#### Generate CroQL with AI

In the **Generate CroQL with AI** field, you can write queries in plain text, which will then be transformed into a CroQL expression using AI. To get the best results possible, make sure your queries are clearly structured. For example, you can enter: *Return strings where there are translations by the user "username" into Ukrainian*. Once you specify your query, press <KBD>Enter</KBD>, and the AI will generate and populate the **CroQL expression** field with the corresponding CroQL expression. Alternatively, you can directly input a pre-prepared CroQL expression in the **CroQL expression** field.

Click **Filter** to apply the specified filter to the strings in the Editor or click **Reset Filter** to clear the current filter settings.

### Pinning Sections

In Side-by-Side or Multilingual modes, you can pin <Icon name="mdi:pin" class="inline-icon" /> specific sections to keep them visible while navigating through other parts of the interface. This helps you access the pinned content quickly without losing sight of essential information.

## Tasks in the Editor

Once a translator or proofreader has a task assigned, all the task details are accessible from the editor:

The name of the task is displayed at the top of the toolbar.

<Image src={taskName} alt="Task name" />

Filters and searches apply to a particular task only.

Task details can be accessed by clicking the menu <Icon name="mdi:menu" class="inline-icon" /> in the upper-left corner.

The task menu consists of the following components and features:

- name, due date, language, type of the task, and assignee
- options to download and upload translations for the particular task
- possibility to quit the particular task editor and show all project strings
- [Replace in Translations](#replace-in-suggested-translations) option
- [Replace in Sources](#replace-in-sources) option

<Image src={taskMenu} alt="Task menu" />
