Below are the principles due to which Crowdin counts words:

* A word is a combination of letters, punctuation marks, and special characters (e.g.:@ \# $ % ^ & \* – _ \` ‘ “) followed by space.
* A sequence of punctuation marks or special characters is not considered a word.
* By default, HTML tags are considered separate words for most formats, except the following ones: HTML, Front Matter HTML, HAML, MD, Front Matter MD, XML, WEBXML, IDML, XLIFF, XLIFF 2.0, ADOC, DOCX, MIF, DITA. You can change the default word count settings in your project's **Settings > Import > Word count**.
* URLs (e.g. `https://crowdin.com`) and emails (e.g. `support@crowdin.com`) are considered one word.
* Hieroglyphs in Chinese, Japanese, and other hieroglyphic languages are counted as one word/hieroglyph. For example, “ライフ・イン・トウキョウ。” is counted as ten words.

Other examples of how the words are counted:
